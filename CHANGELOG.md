## [Unreleased]

## [2.13.5] - 2026-07-14


### Fixed — Startup crash on some PCs after updating ("no such column: archived")
- 2.13.4 added an archive flag to part types. On multi-PC (cloud) setups the underlying column only appears after the **main (primary) PC** has been updated and opened, so a secondary PC that updated first could crash on launch with `no such column: archived`. The app now tolerates the column being absent — it starts normally and simply enables archiving automatically once the main PC's update has synced across. No data was affected.

## [2.13.4] - 2026-07-14


### Fixed — Matrix now separates each model generation
- The matrix drew a separator line between model series, but Samsung generations were grouped by the tens digit — so S24, S25 and S26 all landed in one block with no lines between them. Each numbered generation is now its own group (S25 separate from S26, A54 from A55, …), while a generation's variants (S26, "S26 Ultra", "S26+") stay together. iPhone numeric series are unchanged.

### Fixed — Adding a duplicate model name no longer crashes
- Adding (or renaming to) a model name that already exists raised a raw `UNIQUE constraint failed: phone_models.name` crash. It now shows a clear message that the name is already taken (model names are unique shop-wide).

### Fixed — Analytics now values stock at cost and includes devices
- The Analytics tab showed values that were too high because it valued stock at the **sell** price. Stock Value, Value by Brand and the Valuation Pivot are now computed **at cost** (buy price; a missing cost counts as 0, matching the matrix's Cost view), and the labels say so. They also now **include device units** (phones, tablets, laptops, …), which live in their own table and were previously left out entirely — so a brand's bar and the totals reflect your whole holding, and everything reconciles with the stock-value figure. The dashboard's separate "Inventory Value" (retail) is unchanged.

### Added — Archive a part type instead of losing it
- A part type that has ever been sold, audited or returned can't be hard-deleted (that would erase those records), which previously surfaced as a raw `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` error even after you zeroed its stock. Deleting such a type now explains the situation and offers to **archive** it instead: it disappears from the matrix and the Part Types list (its stock is 0, so it never affected figures) while its history stays intact. A **Show archived** toggle in the Part Types admin lists archived types with a **Restore** button. Empty part types with no history still delete outright, and their leftover zero-stock placeholder rows are cleaned up automatically.

### Changed — Devices tab: collapsible header + resizable unit table
- The Devices tab now has a collapsible **Overview** header (like Inventory and Part Types) — click it to hide the stat cards and give the tables more room. The aggregated grid and the per-model unit table now sit in a draggable splitter, so the second table is much larger by default and you can drag the divider to size it however you like.

### Added — Report PDF button in every device category
- Each device tab (Phones, Tablets, Laptops, Earbuds, Watches, Consoles, Speakers) now has a **Report PDF** button that generates a professional, branded inventory report **for that category alone**. Units are grouped by model with per-model subtotals (count, in-stock, stock value), a KPI header (total units, in stock, sold, stock value at cost, and average battery where relevant), and a full per-unit table (serial, storage, colour, battery, condition, category-specific specs, buy/sell price, status). The report opens automatically in your PDF viewer and is saved under the app's `reports` folder.

### Added — Model filter in the device Labels dialog
- The **Labels** dialog gained a **Model** dropdown so you can print labels for a single model instead of the whole category. And when you already have a model selected in the grid and click **Labels**, the dialog now opens **pre-filtered to that model** — no more scrolling past every other model to find the units you meant.

### Fixed — Audit panel (and price lists) crash in cloud mode
- Surfaced by the built-in error reporting: `'_SplitCloudConnection' object has no attribute 'cursor'`. Some screens (the audit history and price lists) open a database cursor directly, which existed only on the plain local database, not on the cloud connection — so those screens failed to load when cloud sync was on. The cloud connection now provides a compatible cursor, so audit loading and price lists work in cloud mode. Covered by a new CI test.

## [2.13.3] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed — Device labels now include every field (memory, colour, battery, specs)
- The device label export only wrote brand, model, serial and condition — so colour, memory/storage, battery %, and category-specific fields (laptop CPU/RAM/SSD/screen/GPU, watch size/band, console edition, etc.) were missing. Labels now carry **all** of a device's relevant fields for its category, and each category shows only its own fields. The exported file gained dedicated columns (storage, colour, battery, specs) plus a ready-made **`details`** one-line summary, and the export dialog now shows a **Label text** preview column so you can see exactly what the sticker will contain before printing.
- Note: to make the extra fields appear on the printed sticker, point your YunPrint label template at the new columns (the `details` column gives you everything in one line).

## [2.13.2] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed — Matrix jump to the top (all-brands view)
- After the left-right jump was fixed, the all-brands matrix started snapping to the **top** on each operation. Cause was a regression in the previous fix: the scroll-restore gave up after ~0.75 s, but a large all-brands page's scroll range keeps growing past that, so the saved position was never reached. The restore now keeps re-applying as the page settles (up to a few seconds, and only while the content size is still changing — it never fights your own scrolling), so both axes stay put.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added — Faster device entry (prefill, battery, auto-barcode)
- In Devices, selecting a model and clicking **+ Add** now **prefills the form with that model** (brand, model, specs, prices) so entering another unit of it is one step — only the serial/IMEI is left blank for you to fill.
- A brand-new unit now defaults **Battery to 100%**.
- Leaving **Barcode empty auto-fills it from the serial/IMEI**, so every unit is scannable without typing the code twice. (Type a barcode to override.)

### Changed — Dropdown fields now show a visible arrow
- The Brand/Model/Color and other pick-or-type fields were styled with no drop-down arrow, so they looked like plain text boxes. They now show a small arrow indicating you can click to pick from your saved values (you can still type a new one).

### Fixed — Matrix left-right jump (all-brands view)
- The matrix still jumped sideways on each operation in the **All-brands** view: the earlier fix only restored horizontal scroll for the single-brand view. Horizontal scroll is now preserved for every brand section in all-brands mode too, and the restore re-asserts across the whole rebuild so a late relayout can't snap it back to the start.

### Fixed — Cloud sync errors now self-heal instead of failing
- Surfaced by the built-in error reporting: some PCs hit "Cloud sync failed — WAL frame insert conflict" and "database disk image is malformed". Cause: the fast local copy of the database can get its sync position invalidated (the cloud compacts its change-log server-side) or its file damaged (an interrupted sync), which a plain reconnect can't fix. The app now **detects this and rebuilds the local copy fresh from the cloud automatically**, then retries — so a sync hiccup or a damaged local file becomes an invisible recovery instead of a failed refresh or a repeated error. Safe because the local copy is read-only (it holds no unsaved changes). Covered by new CI tests.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed — Matrix no longer jumps sideways on every operation
- Every stock edit rebuilds the matrix, which reset the **horizontal** scroll back to the start — so the view jumped left/right on each action. Root cause: the tab restored the *vertical* position robustly (waiting for the rebuilt table's scroll range to settle) but the horizontal position was only patched inside the table widget, which ran too early and got wiped. Horizontal scroll is now restored the same robust way, in the one authoritative place after the whole refresh settles. Both the inventory matrix and the Part Types matrices are covered, and the fragile per-widget attempts that fought the timing were removed.

### Changed — Device add/edit dropdowns now populate from your existing data
- In the Devices add/edit dialog, **Brand**, **Model** and **Color** are pick-or-type dropdowns fed from data you already have. Their sourcing is now broader so they're useful everywhere:
  - **Brand** is shop-wide across every device category — Apple/Samsung/Xiaomi/… show up even in a category you haven't added to yet (previously each category only saw its own brands, so new ones were blank).
  - **Color** now also includes the colour list already used in your parts inventory (Black, Blue, Gold, Green, …), so phones — which were migrated without a colour — get a full colour dropdown immediately instead of an empty one.
  - **Model** stays category-specific (an iPhone model shouldn't appear for laptops).
- The remaining free-text spec fields that behave like shared vocabulary — watch **Band** and console **Edition** — are now pick-or-type dropdowns too, so they accumulate the values you use. You can always still type a new value in any of these.

## [2.12.1] - 2026-07-13

### Changed — Quieter logs for a self-healed cloud hiccup
- A rare, transient cloud-driver hiccup that the app already **recovers from automatically** (it reconnects and retries the read, which succeeds) was being logged as a scary "panic" WARNING. It now logs quietly at debug level when the retry succeeds; only a hiccup that *survives* the retry is surfaced. No behaviour change — the app was already handling it correctly; this just stops the alarming message for something that was never a problem.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed — Phones now live under Devices; the old Phones tab is removed
- All phone units were consolidated into **Devices → Phones** and the standalone **Phones tab has been removed**. Every phone (290 units) was migrated and verified as an exact copy — units, status, prices and details all match — before the tab was retired. Scanning a phone's IMEI still works: it now opens the phone from Devices.
- The old phone database is **kept as a backup** (nothing deleted); the app simply no longer shows the separate tab, so all phones are managed in one place going forward and can't drift between two lists again.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed — Cloud mode is fast again: local reads + safe cloud writes
- Browsing every tab is instant once more. The previous version read live from the cloud on every query (~58 ms each), so tab-heavy screens felt slow; now reads come from a **local copy of the database** (measured ~0.7 ms) while writes still go straight to the shared cloud, so several PCs stay safe editing at once. Verified against the production database: reads ~0.7 ms, writes ~330 ms, and you always see your own change immediately after saving.
- This is the proven "local-first" design (fast local reads, one authoritative cloud for writes). Unlike the earlier offline-writes attempt, the local copy is **read-only** — it can't diverge, so the "server returned a conflict" error cannot happen. Other PCs' changes arrive on the regular sync tick (Admin → Cloud Sync interval); your own changes show instantly.
- Where the fast local engine isn't available (rare), the app automatically uses the direct cloud connection — correct, just not as fast. A CI test proves reads/writes route correctly and that your own writes are always visible.

## [2.10.2] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed — Matrix: column widths and scroll position no longer reset on every edit
- The SELL/COST/TOTAL columns are wider by default so a full price fits without resizing. When you *do* resize a column, it now stays that width — previously every stock in/out or admin edit re-rendered the matrix and snapped it back to default.
- The matrix no longer jumps back to the start (left/right) after each operation; your horizontal and vertical scroll position is preserved across edits.
- Applies to every matrix in the app (inventory tabs, Part Types, admin panels). A CI test guards against the reset returning.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed — Cloud sync conflict (`server returned a conflict`) + safe multi-PC writes
- The offline-write mode added in the previous version was **single-writer**: when two PCs edit the shared cloud database, their local write histories diverge and sync fails with `server returned a conflict` — and, worse, a stale local copy could show stock another PC already sold. Cloud mode now talks to the **one live cloud database directly** from every PC: always consistent, everyone sees each other's changes immediately, and the conflict can no longer occur (there is no local copy to diverge). Writes go straight to the cloud (~150 ms measured) instead of the old ~1.3 s, so stock in/out and admin edits stay fast without the freeze.
- No data was lost in the conflict — local and cloud were verified identical. On update, the leftover local cache (including any stuck un-synced bookkeeping) is cleared automatically; nothing to do by hand.
- Trade-off: because every PC now reads live data instead of a local copy, browsing fetches over the network (tens of milliseconds per query) rather than instantly — the necessary cost of every PC seeing the same up-to-the-second stock. Operations run off the UI thread, so the app stays responsive.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed — Stock in/out and admin edits are now instant in cloud mode
- Writes still travelled to the cloud one statement at a time (~1.2 s each measured), so scans and admin edits crawled even after reads became local. The replica now uses **offline writes**: changes land in the local database instantly (~1 ms measured) and are pushed to the cloud by the background sync — delivery verified end-to-end against the production database. Pending changes also push when the app closes, and unpushed changes survive restarts.
- Trade-off, in line with the app's offline-first design: another PC sees a change after both sides' next sync tick (worst case ~2 minutes, previously ~1). In exchange, every operation on every PC is interactive.
- A sync slower than 30 seconds now reports itself as a degraded event, so chronic sync problems surface before anyone complains.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added — Automatic anonymous error reporting
- The app now reports crashes, errors and degraded conditions (e.g. running offline because the cloud is unreachable) automatically, so problems at any PC get fixed without anyone having to report them. Identical failures from all machines are grouped into a single issue, tagged with the app version, edition and cloud mode, and each report carries the recent log context needed to diagnose it.
- **Anonymous and scrubbed by design**: no shop data, no names, no inventory contents — reports contain the error and app version only. The machine is identified by a one-way hash (so "affects 4 machines" is countable without knowing which), the computer name is stripped, and Windows user-profile paths are masked everywhere. A CI gate enforces this privacy contract on every build.
- **Visible off-switch**: Admin → Shop Settings → Privacy → "Send anonymous error reports" (on by default, applies immediately, stored only on this PC).

## [2.8.5] - 2026-07-10


### Fixed — `ValueError: no such column: updated_at` crash in cloud mode
- The native replica driver reports SQL errors as plain `ValueError`, while the app's fallback handlers (matrix-fingerprint `updated_at` probe, FK-safe delete, duplicate-key paths) catch the standard `sqlite3` exception types — so a routine, deliberately-probed error crashed instead of falling back. The replica wrapper now maps driver SQL errors to the matching `sqlite3` types (constraint violations → `IntegrityError`, everything else → `OperationalError`), preserving the message verbatim — the same contract the HTTP client has had since 2.6.4. Two new gate tests pin it down.

## [2.8.4] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed — Recurring `libsql panic` warnings after every cloud sync
- The panic root cause wasn't threading after all: libsql 0.1.x poisons a connection's internal state after `sync()`, so the first statement on the old handle panics (`Option::unwrap() on a None value`) — with a sync every minute, that was a warning per minute (2.8.2 crashed outright; 2.8.3 contained it as a task error). The wrapper now rebuilds the native handle right after every sync (a purely local, milliseconds operation), so callers never touch the poisoned handle, and if any panic still occurs it reconnects and retries the statement once. Inside a transaction it never retries partial work — the transaction fails cleanly and the healed connection serves the next caller.
- The thread-safety CI gate grew to 8 tests covering the self-healing paths: one-shot panic heals invisibly, sync rebuilds the handle, in-transaction panics abort without retry.

## [2.8.3] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed — 2.8.2 froze at startup (2%) and crashed workers in cloud mode
- **Startup freeze**: 2.8.2 built the cloud replica on the UI thread during database initialisation — with a stale replica cache that build could hang for minutes ("not responding" at 2%). The replica is now built on a background thread after migrations complete; the app starts immediately and serves queries over the (keep-alive) HTTP connection until the replica is ready, then switches automatically. A corrupted/outdated replica cache is now detected, deleted and re-pulled fresh instead of hanging.
- **Worker crashes** (`PanicException: Option::unwrap() on a None value`): the native replica driver is not thread-safe, and page queries could race the background sync inside it. Every database operation now goes through one lock with results read under that lock, and any residual driver panic surfaces as a normal database error instead of killing the thread. A new CI gate (`test_replica_wrapper`) hammers the wrapper from 8 threads and fails the build on any concurrency regression.
- The Logs cloud-sync card now reports "Embedded replica" only when the replica is actually serving queries (previously it claimed replica mode even while still on HTTP).

## [2.8.2] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed — Cloud mode is now fast: the app finally ships its embedded-replica engine
- **What was wrong**: every installed app in cloud (replica) mode ran on the worst-case fallback path — each SQL statement was sent as its own HTTPS request on a brand-new connection (~400 ms per statement measured), so every screen, search and save paid seconds of network time. The app has always *preferred* a libSQL embedded replica (reads/writes hit a local file instantly and sync with the cloud in the background), but the native `libsql` driver was never included in the installer, so no installed copy could ever use it.
- **Fix 1 — ship the replica engine**: `libsql` is now a pinned dependency and is bundled into the installer; the release pipeline refuses to publish a build that is missing it. In cloud mode, reads now come from the local replica file (instant, works offline) and changes sync with the cloud in the background — this is the designed architecture, active for the first time in an installed build.
- **Fix 2 — 6.5× faster HTTP fallback**: the HTTP path (used briefly at startup while the replica is built, and wherever the native driver is unavailable) now keeps its connections alive instead of paying a fresh TLS handshake per statement: measured 378 ms → 58 ms per query.
- Tip: the active mode is visible under Logs → cloud-sync card — it should read "Embedded replica" after this update, not "HTTP API".

### Fixed — Untranslated pages: the UI now follows a language switch everywhere
- Large parts of the app stayed English after switching to Arabic or German: Sales, Reports, Analytics, Barcode Generator, Devices, Part Types, Quick Scan, Transactions and the Customers page all kept their construction-time texts. Two causes, both fixed: many pages had stub `retranslate()` methods that never re-applied header/button/placeholder texts, and dozens of strings (analytics sections/KPI/chart titles, report cards, matrix filter chips, devices category tabs, barcode-generator options and statuses, tooltips) were hardcoded in English with no translation entry at all.
- ~180 new translation keys added with full German and Arabic coverage; every page now implements a real `retranslate()`; device category tabs translate by key while custom categories keep their stored name.
- The CI guard that protects against this regression was extended: it now scans labels, placeholders, tooltips, window titles, tabs and group boxes across all pages, tabs, components and dialogs — previously it only checked buttons and table headers.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed — Startup crashed in cloud mode: `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` during the devices migration
- On a cloud database that reached schema V24 before category seeding existed, `device_categories` is empty — the V25 phones-to-devices backfill then violates its foreign key and aborts startup. The cloud always enforces foreign keys (a local DB by default does not), which is why this only hit cloud-connected PCs. The V25 migration now seeds the device categories itself before backfilling, so it completes on any V24 database regardless of how it got there.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-06


### Fixed — Installed 2.7.9 crashed immediately at startup
- The 2.7.9 installer shipped without the license public key file that the new edition system reads at launch, so the installed app died with "No such file or directory: …license_pubkey.pem" before showing a window. The file is now bundled, and the release pipeline verifies required runtime files are present in the build before publishing anything.
- **If you already installed 2.7.9**: the app can't start (so it can't self-update) — download and run this version's installer manually; your data is preserved.

### Fixed — Release pipeline: changelog publish to the public repo
- The final release step failed when the changelog grew large (the file content was passed as an inline command argument and exceeded the OS limit). The payload is now handed over via a temp file, so the publish works regardless of file size. No changes to the app itself.

## [2.7.9] - 2026-07-06


### Added — Devices module: full inventory for tablets, laptops, watches & more (Pro)
- New **Devices** area with per-category dual-table pages (unit grid + detail) that mirror the proven phones workflow — for Tablets, Laptops, Earbuds, Watches, Consoles and Speakers, each with its own line icon in the sidebar.
- **Schema-driven add/edit dialogs**: every category shows exactly its own fields with the right dropdowns (including watch size), driven by a single per-category field schema.
- **Combo (select-or-type) fields** for brand, model, color, CPU, screen and GPU that learn from the data already in your shop — pick an existing value or type a new one.
- Professional detail presentation: status badges, colour swatches, battery/condition badges, and consistent currency/battery formatting.
- Full device life-cycle: device movements appear in the **Transactions** view, every category has a **sold-devices history**, a **scan-to-sell** popup opens straight from the header search, and **barcode labels** can be exported and assigned.
- Under the hood: schema v23 → v25 migration with seeded device categories, an index on device transactions, and a complete model/repository/service layer covered by backend tests.

### Added — Part Types page (Pro)
- Dedicated **Part Types** page with dual-table browse and its own sidebar entry; the tab hosts the real per-category matrix behind a category header, with working zoom.
- **Icons for categories and part types**: a bundled SVG icon set with a picker dialog (schema v26).
- New Pro tabs for part types: **Sold History** and **Direct Labels**.

### Added — Free/Pro editions with offline licensing
- The app now runs as **Free** or **Pro**. Pro features show a clear upgrade prompt with a teaser preview instead of being silently absent.
- **Offline activation** with signed license keys bound to a machine fingerprint (grouped customer ids activate correctly; matching ignores case and hyphens). Activation applies live — no restart needed.
- The footer shows an **edition badge** and, during the trial, a countdown that ticks hourly.
- Trial state is stored redundantly (file + registry, reconciled) and fails closed on a corrupt marker.
- Gated Pro surfaces: the 11 Pro PDF reports, Pro write-actions (edit/delete/send/remove), the admin suppliers panel, and device power features.

### Changed — Complete UI redesign (header, sidebar, footer, themes)
- A **cohesive SVG line-icon set replaces emoji everywhere** — sidebar, header, admin dialog, category nav and zoom control — recoloured live for active state and theme.
- **Sidebar**: grouped into five labelled sections (Inventory / Sales / Purchasing / Reports / System); the hamburger collapses it to an icon-only rail with tooltips; thin scrollbar.
- **Header**: shows the current page name as breadcrumb context, plus a leading search glyph and tightened search field.
- **Footer**: status groups segmented IDE-style with subtle dividers; version/time now readable in light mode.
- **Themes**: five new accent families (Ocean, Violet, Amber, Rose, Slate), each in dark and light, plus a new **Appearance** settings panel with live theme preview cards. All chrome icons recolour instantly on theme change.

### Fixed — Startup no longer crashes when the cloud is unreachable
- When the cloud host can't be reached, the app degrades to the offline local database and keeps working instead of crashing at startup.

### Changed — Licensing & translations
- Source license switched to a proprietary Oranovix license (supersedes the PolyForm Noncommercial notice from 2.7.6).
- Remaining hardcoded UI strings routed through translations with real EN/DE/AR coverage, protected by a guard test so new hardcoded strings fail CI.

### Changed — Release & CI pipeline
- Installers, the update manifest and the changelog are now published to the public distribution repo, so installed apps keep updating regardless of the source repository's visibility.
- The UI smoke gate no longer fails on a library shutdown crash that occurred after all tests had already passed.

## [2.7.8] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed — "Initialize as Replica" didn't survive an app restart
- A PC set up as a replica silently reverted to its local database on the next launch. The replica switch is now persisted, so the PC reconnects to the shared cloud database after every restart.

### Changed
- The startup health check now names the exact tables with foreign-key violations instead of a generic warning.
- Public-safe LICENSE text and a new editions page.

## [2.7.7] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed — Sales "Items Sold" KPI always showed 0
- The KPI now counts sold items correctly.

### Added — CI gate: every page and dialog must construct
- A UI construction smoke test builds the entire UI in CI, catching the class of regression (broken pages/dialogs after a merge) that previously reached users.

### Changed — Faster dashboard, complete translations
- Dashboard aggregates are cached with write invalidation, so the dashboard opens noticeably faster.
- Translation coverage completed: 58 missing keys added and 61 hardcoded strings translated (EN/DE/AR).

## [2.7.6] - 2026-07-03

### Added — One-click error report bundle
- Logs and diagnostics can be bundled into a single file to send along when something goes wrong.

### Fixed — Replica startup froze at 2%
- Building the cloud connection is now time-bounded; the app continues starting and uses the fallback connection until the replica is ready.

### Fixed — Phone label export restored
- The phone label export dialog was lost in the v2.6.7 integration merge and is back.

### Changed — Performance and licensing
- Matrix pages and the zoom control no longer freeze the UI (async matrix queries; sampled + debounced zoom); the last synchronous page queries moved to the worker pool.
- Future versions licensed under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.

## [2.7.5] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed — Cloud replica switching is now trustworthy
- Switching to replica performs a real pull and verifies the data actually arrived; the sync indicator reports status honestly; views auto-refresh after a sync.
- After a mirror push the app now offers to switch the PC to replica mode — previously the pushing PC stayed primary and never saw later cloud changes.
- Replica startup no longer freezes on the splash screen (the startup cloud sync is time-bounded).

## [2.7.4] - 2026-07-02

- Re-release of 2.7.3 to recover a failed release-pipeline run — no application changes.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed — Cloud push aborted mid-sync on duplicate phone model names
- Pushing to the cloud failed on the phone models unique-name constraint and aborted partway through. The push now handles already-existing names and completes.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-07-02

- Ships the 2.7.1 changes (that release run failed before publishing). The release pipeline was hardened: a PR-mergeability race was fixed and main is now merged back into dev after each release.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-07-02

### Added — Mirror push: make the cloud an exact copy of this PC
- A deliberate, confirmed alternative to the safe merge push for when the cloud should be reset to exactly this PC's data.
- Note: the 2.7.1 release run failed before publishing — these changes first shipped with 2.7.2.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-02

### Changed — Major performance pass (three phases)
- Barcode PDF generation ~2.5× faster; searches debounced; page loads deferred.
- Inventory action buttons build lazily and hidden pages defer their restyles.
- Lazy page imports and batched N+1 query patterns cut startup and navigation time.

### Fixed — Phone barcode scanning restored
- Phone barcode scanning was lost in the v2.6.7 integration merge and is back.

## [2.6.9] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed — App crashed on startup
- A missing translation import in the sync indicator crashed the app at launch.

### Changed
- Installer wizard images now show the correct version automatically; README screenshots refreshed with a populated demo dataset.

## [2.6.8] - 2026-07-01

### Changed — Admin panels open instantly
- Blocking database queries in the admin panels are deferred, so the admin dialog opens immediately.

## [2.6.7] - 2026-07-01


### Changed — Cloud push is now non-destructive (safe merge)
- **What**: "Push local data to cloud" (formerly "Initialize as Primary") now **merges** — it UPSERTs every row by primary key and **never drops cloud tables**. Rows that exist only in the cloud are always preserved, so pushing from a PC that holds less data can no longer wipe the shared database.
- **Why**: the old behaviour dropped and recreated every cloud table before re-inserting, so a push from a stale PC destroyed newer cloud data — the root cause of the "all my phones disappeared" scare.
- **Safety**: before pushing, a **pre-push diff** shows exactly what will be inserted, updated, and kept untouched. A new CI gate (`test_sync_upsert`) fails the build if the push ever becomes destructive again.

### Fixed — `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` crashes in cloud mode (app-wide)
- **User-visible symptom**: `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` crash when saving a model's colour selection (or "No Colors"), and the same latent risk on startup/refresh and when deleting products.
- **Root cause**: several paths deleted `inventory_items` rows that history (transactions, sales, audits, price lists) still referenced. SQLite doesn't enforce foreign keys by default, but the cloud (Turso) always does, so the delete failed.
- **Fix**: a shared **FK-safe delete** helper (`delete_inventory_where_safe`) now backs every matrix/part-type cleanup — it tries a fast bulk delete and, on an FK violation, falls back to per-row deletion that **skips rows still referenced by history** (they're `stock=0` and harmless). Deleting a product that has history now shows a clear "can't delete — set stock to 0" message instead of crashing. Covered by a new CI gate. Surfaced thanks to the new traceback-rich logs pinpointing the exact line.

### Added — Logs now show the real error (traceback detail)
- Previously an unhandled error showed only `[CRITICAL] [__main__] Unhandled exception` with no clue what failed. Now the collapsed row reads e.g. `Unhandled OperationalError: no such column: x`, and **double-clicking any row opens a detail pane with the full, copyable traceback**. Qt warnings/errors and worker-thread crashes are now captured into the logs too (they previously went only to stderr).

### Changed — Faster DB access (no connection churn)
- Three repositories (`audit`, `price_list`, `supplier`) closed the shared per-thread SQLite connection after every call, forcing a reconnect + PRAGMA re-apply on the next query. They now reuse the cached connection like the rest of the app.

## [2.6.6] - 2026-06-16

### Added — Professional in-app logging & diagnostics
- **What**: a dedicated **Logs** screen (sidebar tab + a pop-out window you can keep open on a second monitor) that shows everything the app does in real time — colour-coded by level, with filters for level, source, and free-text search, a verbose (DEBUG) toggle for troubleshooting, pause/resume live tail, and one-click **Copy**, **Export**, **Open log file**, and **Open folder**.
- **How**: logging now feeds an in-memory ring buffer (last 5,000 records) alongside the existing rotating log file, so any message logged anywhere in the app appears in the viewer instantly without touching disk. The buffer is framework-free and thread-safe; the UI marshals records onto the main thread via a queued Qt signal.
- **Passive awareness**: a professional health indicator in the footer (an ECG/pulse glyph) stays green when all is well and turns amber/red with a count when unseen warnings or errors arrive. Clicking it opens the logs and clears the counter. Errors also surface as a toast (throttled, with a "View logs" action), including inside the pop-out log window.
- **Access**: available to everyone; fully translated (EN/DE/AR).

### Added — Cloud-sync observability
- **What**: the Logs screen now has a **cloud-sync diagnostics card** showing live status (OK / in progress / error), the active **mode · role · host** (e.g. `Embedded replica · Replica · …` or `HTTP API · Replica · …`), a **Sync now** button, and a **Cloud sync only** filter to audit the full sync timeline without noise.
- **How**: successful syncs are now logged at **INFO** (previously DEBUG, so they were invisible in production) with the elapsed time and connection mode; failures remain ERROR. A new secrets-free `connection_mode()` reporter describes the active connection for display.

### Fixed — Startup health check falsely reported UNHEALTHY in cloud mode
- **User-visible symptom**: on a cloud-synced PC the startup health check failed with `Integrity check error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` (now visible thanks to the new Logs screen).
- **Root cause**: `PRAGMA integrity_check` returns no row over the Turso HTTP connection, so `fetchone()[0]` dereferenced `None`. It only ever worked because local SQLite always returns a row.
- **Fix**: the integrity check now guards the result and treats "no row" as *unverifiable (OK)* over a remote connection instead of a hard failure, so cloud-sync mode is no longer reported UNHEALTHY.

### Fixed — Phones disappeared after sync due to replica mode
- **User-visible symptom**: after syncing, all phones appeared to be gone from the UI, even though the database still contained 165 phones (130 in stock, 35 sold).
- **Root cause**: the sync_role was set to "replica", which caused the app to read from the cloud database instead of the local database. The cloud database was empty, so no phones were displayed.
- **Fix**: changed sync_role from "replica" to "primary" in the database configuration. The app now reads from the local database where the phones are stored.

### Fixed — Scanner input with spaces between prefix and barcode failed
- **User-visible symptom**: some scanners output spaces between the prefix character and the barcode payload (e.g., "f      IPßXSßDDSO"), causing barcode lookups to fail. Command barcodes also stopped working.
- **Root cause**: the scanner input processing did not handle spaces between the prefix and the barcode, so the normalized input didn't match stored barcodes.
- **Fix**: added space removal to barcode scanner input processing in `barcode_line_edit.py`, `scan_config.py`, and `main_window.py`. The normalization now removes all spaces before processing, preserving the existing German keyboard ß handling.

---

## [2.6.5] - 2026-06-15

### Added — Offline-first cloud sync via libSQL embedded replicas
- **What**: in cloud (replica) mode the app now reads and writes a **local SQLite replica file** (instant, no per-query network round-trip) and `sync()`s it with the Turso primary, instead of sending every query over HTTP. This is the architecture for a travelling-owner + shop-PC setup: every PC keeps a local copy that stays in step with the one shared cloud database.
- **How**: a new `_LibsqlReplicaConnection` (single connection, lock-held per transaction) presents the same `_DictRow` interface as the existing connections, so repositories are unchanged. `get_connection()` prefers it in replica mode; the periodic Sync Now / background tick performs a real `sync()`; on startup the replica pulls the latest from the primary.
- **Graceful fallback**: the native `libsql` package only ships wheels for cp39–cp313, so where it isn't available (e.g. Python 3.14) the app automatically falls back to the pure-stdlib Turso HTTP client — nothing breaks, you just don't get the local cache there.
- **Verified in CI**: a new `tests/test_embedded_replica.py` runs the full write → sync → read-back round-trip against a throwaway Turso database (via `TURSO_TEST_URL` / `TURSO_TEST_TOKEN` secrets) and gates the release, so a broken sync can never ship. It skips cleanly when the secrets aren't set.

## [2.6.4] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed — Cloud upload still failed with FOREIGN KEY constraint (the actual cause)
- **User-visible symptom**: "Initialize as Primary" kept failing with `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` on `model_part_type_colors`, even after the earlier delete-order and DROP/recreate fixes.
- **Root cause**: the earlier fixes only addressed *delete* order — the *insert* order was wrong. `_SYNCED_TABLES` listed `model_part_type_colors` and `inventory_items` (which reference `phone_models`) **before** `phone_models`, so their rows were inserted while the parent table was still empty.
- **Fix**: reordered `_SYNCED_TABLES` so `phone_models` is pushed before everything that references it, and the cloud schema is now dropped children-first then recreated from the current `_DDL`. A new CI gate (`test_synced_tables_are_in_fk_dependency_order`) parses the schema's foreign keys and fails if any table is pushed before a table it references — so this can't regress.

### Fixed — Cloud upload timed out on large tables ("The read operation timed out")
- **User-visible symptom**: after the FK-order fix, "Initialize as Primary" failed on `model_part_type_colors` with `The read operation timed out`.
- **Root cause**: `executemany` sent every row of a table in a **single** HTTP pipeline request; Turso runs the whole pipeline in one round-trip, so a table with thousands of rows couldn't be processed before the 30 s read timeout fired.
- **Fix**: the Turso client now inserts rows in batches of 400 per request (so no single request is huge), and the HTTP read timeout was raised to 60 s.

### Changed — A PC stays on the shared cloud after "Initialize as Primary"
- "Initialize as Primary" now switches the PC to work **directly on the cloud** after the one-time upload (it previously stayed on its local DB). Combined with the other PCs running "Initialize as Replica", **all machines share one live dataset and stay in sync** — which is what a travelling-owner + shop-PC setup needs. The local DB is left untouched as a pre-sync backup.

### Fixed — App crashed on startup in replica mode (Turso exception type)
- **User-visible symptom**: `RuntimeError: Turso SQL error: … no such column: updated_at` crashed startup when running against the cloud (replica mode).
- **Root cause**: the Turso HTTP client raised a bare `RuntimeError` for every SQL error, so `sqlite3.OperationalError` fallbacks (e.g. the matrix-fingerprint "table has no updated_at" path) never triggered over the cloud connection.
- **Fix**: the Turso client now raises the matching `sqlite3` exception type (`IntegrityError` for constraint violations, `OperationalError` otherwise), so sqlite3 error handling behaves identically over the cloud connection.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed — Persistent foreign key constraint errors during cloud upload
- **User-visible symptom**: "Initialize as Primary" continued to fail with foreign key constraint errors even after fixing the deletion order and attempting to disable FK constraints via PRAGMA.
- **Root cause**: Turso's HTTP API ignores all PRAGMA statements (including `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF`), so FK constraints cannot be disabled. The DELETE approach still violated FK constraints because Turso enforces them differently than local SQLite.
- **Fix**: changed approach from DELETE to DROP TABLE IF EXISTS for all synced tables before recreating the schema. Dropping tables completely removes FK constraints, then recreating the schema with `executescript(_DDL)` ensures clean tables. Data is then inserted in forward order (parents before children) to satisfy FK constraints. This approach works reliably with Turso's HTTP API.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed — Cloud upload ("Initialize as Primary") failed with foreign key constraint error
- **User-visible symptom**: uploading a PC's data to the cloud (Admin → Cloud Sync → **Initialize as Primary**) failed with `Upload failed: Turso SQL error: SQLite error: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`.
- **Root cause**: `push_local_to_turso()` deleted tables in the same order as insertion (parents first, then children). This violates foreign key constraints when child rows still reference parent rows that are being deleted.
- **Fix**: delete tables in **reverse order** (children before parents) to avoid FK violations, while keeping insert order as-is (parents before children) to satisfy FK constraints.

### Fixed — Data loss after updating to 2.6.0 when cloud sync was enabled
- **User-visible symptom**: after updating to 2.6.0, all data appeared to be gone for users who had cloud sync enabled.
- **Root cause**: the 2.6.0 fix for cloud sync settings changed `ShopConfig` to always use `get_local_connection()`, but `get_connection()` still routed to the cloud database whenever `cloud_sync_enabled == "1"`. This caused the app to read config from the local database (which might be empty or outdated) while routing data operations to the cloud database. If the local DB was initialized as fresh, users would see an empty database while their actual data remained in the cloud.
- **Fix**: `get_connection()` now checks the `sync_role` setting and only routes to the cloud database when the role is "replica" (cloud as primary). In "primary" mode, it uses the local database and pushes to the cloud on-demand via "Initialize as Primary". This ensures data is never lost during updates.

### Fixed — "Initialize as Primary" could wipe cloud database with empty local data
- **User-visible symptom**: running "Initialize as Primary" with an empty or incomplete local database would wipe the cloud database, causing permanent data loss.
- **Root cause**: `push_local_to_turso()` deleted all rows from the cloud database before inserting local data, without checking if the local database actually contained meaningful data.
- **Fix**: added a safety check that verifies the local database has data before wiping the cloud. If the local database is empty, the function now raises a RuntimeError with a clear error message, preventing accidental data loss.

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added — CI workflow with release-readiness tests
- New `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push / PR to `dev` and `main`: a ruff lint plus two new, properly-isolated tests that target the exact bugs hit this cycle —
  - **Schema parity** (`tests/test_schema_parity.py`): asserts the base `_DDL` already contains every column any migration adds via `ALTER TABLE`, so a database built directly from the schema (fresh/cloud) is never missing a column. This would have caught `no such column: cost_price`.
  - **Report smoke** (`tests/test_report_smoke.py`): generates every PDF report against a seeded multi-page dataset and asserts no exception, pages > 0, and no blank pages.
- The release README now carries an auto-stamped **"Current release: vX.Y.Z"** line (the action updates it alongside the version badge), and the stale hand-written version history was replaced with a milestones table + a link to this changelog as the single source of truth.

### Fixed — `suppliers.rating` / `updated_at` missing from fresh databases (schema drift)
- Caught by the new schema-parity test: `_DDL` had two `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS suppliers` definitions, and the older one (without `rating`/`updated_at`) won — so a fresh or cloud database lacked those columns even though the migration chain adds them. The base definition now matches the canonical one.

### Fixed — Dashboard "Out of stock" was massively inflated; stock-health donut read "Out 100%"
- The matrix seeds a zero-stock placeholder row for every model × part × colour combo. `out_of_stock_count` counted *all* zero-stock rows (so a small shop showed "1,438 out of stock"), and the analytics stock-health donut used a standalone-products total against an all-items low/out count — rendering as a meaningless solid-red "Out 100%".
- **Fix**: "out of stock" now counts only actively-managed items (those with a min-stock threshold set), and the donut is computed over that same managed population, so its slices (Healthy / Low / Out) are consistent and accurate. Added a `managed_count` to the summary for this.

### Changed — Phones page KPI cards now match the Analytics dashboard
- The Phones page KPI metrics (total / in stock / sold / avg battery / stock value) were unstyled floating text. They're now proper framed tiles with uppercase labels, large values and colour-coded accent underlines, and the page no longer leaves a large empty gap between the cards and the grid.

### Changed — README refreshed for 2.6.0 with new screenshots
- README updated for the Phones (IMEI) module, optional cloud sync, and the 14 PDF reports; schema badge/section bumped to V23 (27 tables); all app screenshots regenerated from a populated demo dataset, with new Phones and Reports shots.

### Added — Schema column-ensure now works over the cloud connection
- The startup `cost_price` column-ensure now also applies over the Turso HTTP connection (attempt-and-ignore-duplicate), so an existing cloud database missing the column is healed on next launch rather than failing reports/analytics with `no such column: cost_price`.

### Fixed — "Save and enable cloud sync settings first" kept appearing after enabling
- **User-visible symptom**: after ticking *Enable cloud sync*, entering credentials and clicking *Save Settings*, the *Initialize as Primary/Replica* and *Sync Now* actions still complained "Save and enable cloud sync settings first."
- **Root cause**: `ShopConfig` was read and written through the cloud-aware connection dispatcher. The instant cloud sync was toggled on in memory, *saving* the settings was routed to the cloud database, while the reload fell back to the local database — which never received the flag — so the app always read cloud sync as still disabled (a circular bootstrap).
- **Fix**: bootstrap config (the cloud-sync on/off flag, Turso URL/token, and all shop settings) now always persists to and loads from the **local** database via a dedicated `get_local_connection()`. Enabling cloud sync takes effect immediately, so the Initialize/Sync actions work.

## [2.5.10] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed — Cloud upload ("Initialize as Primary") failed with a Turso parse error
- **User-visible symptom**: uploading a PC's data to the cloud (Admin → Cloud Sync → **Initialize as Primary**) failed immediately with `Upload failed: Turso SQL error: SQL string could not be parsed: unexpected end of input`.
- **Root cause**: the Turso HTTP client builds the cloud schema by splitting the DDL on `;`, but two schema comments contain a literal `;` (e.g. `-- … for that model; when absent …`). Splitting first cut those `CREATE TABLE` statements in half, so Turso received a comment-only fragment it couldn't parse. Local SQLite ignores comments entirely, so this only ever surfaced on cloud upload.
- **Fix**: strip SQL line comments **before** splitting the DDL into statements, so semicolons inside comments can no longer break a statement. All 68 schema statements now upload cleanly, so Initialize as Primary (and the phone-units migration that depends on it) works.

### Fixed — PDF report rows overlapped into an unreadable block
- **User-visible symptom**: in the Inventory, Low Stock, Expiring and Phone Inventory PDF reports, every row in a group (and the subtotal) rendered stacked on top of each other at the same vertical position, producing a garbled, unreadable block.
- **Root cause**: after drawing each row's coloured status/urgency badge as an overlay, the cursor was advanced with `pdf.ln(0)`, which left the Y position at the *top* of the row just drawn instead of moving to the next line — so every subsequent row painted over the previous one.
- **Fix**: restore the cursor to the bottom of the row (`y_before + row_height`) after the badge overlay, in all four affected tables. Verified every table's columns still sum to the 186 mm usable width.

### Fixed — Arrow character rendered as "?" in PDF subtitles
- The `→` used in report subtitles (e.g. "grouped by category → part type") showed as `?` because it wasn't in the Latin-1 substitution map. Added `→ ← ↔ ✓ ✗` mappings so they render as readable ASCII.

### Fixed — Blank/near-empty pages between full pages in PDF reports
- **User-visible symptom**: long reports (Inventory, Audit, etc.) inserted one or two nearly-empty pages after each full page, roughly doubling the page count.
- **Root cause**: fpdf's automatic page-break fired in the *middle* of a row, then the coloured status badge — drawn as a separate overlay positioned from the row's pre-break Y — landed on yet another page, so a single row was smeared across three pages.
- **Fix**: disabled fpdf's auto page-break and made every table do proactive page breaks (checking there's room for the next row/subtotal/group-header before drawing, and redrawing column + "(continued)" headers on each new page). A 3,200-row test report dropped from 215 pages (≈70 wasted) to 87 pages with **zero** empty pages; continuation pages now always carry their headers.

### Fixed — Stock value crashed on databases without a cost_price column
- `inventory_items.cost_price` (added by the V16 migration and used by the new cost-basis stock value) was missing from the base `_DDL`, so a database created directly from the schema — including a fresh **Turso cloud** database — lacked the column and made reports/analytics fail with `no such column: cost_price`.
- **Fix**: added `cost_price` to the `inventory_items` DDL and an idempotent startup column-ensure, so fresh, migrated, cloud, and previously-inconsistent databases all have it.

### Changed — Installer wizard now uses the cube app logo
- The setup wizard's large banner and small corner image were regenerated from the cube app logo (`icon_cube`) — the banner shows the cube on a branded navy→emerald gradient, the corner image on white — replacing the previous placeholder art. The setup/EXE icon was already the cube icon.

## [2.5.9] - 2026-06-12

### Added — Phone-inventory PDF reports (Parts **and** Phones now both fully reportable)
- Two new professional, branded PDF reports on the **Reports** tab, shown only when the **Phones** module is enabled:
  - **📱 Phone Inventory** — every IMEI-tracked unit grouped by brand, with model / IMEI / storage / condition / battery / buy / sell and a colour-coded status badge (IN STOCK / SOLD / RESERVED). KPI header (total units, in stock, sold, **stock value at cost**, avg battery) and a grand-total bar.
  - **💸 Phones Sold** — sold-unit history for the selected date range (sold-on, brand, model, IMEI, sale price, note) with revenue / avg-sale-price KPIs.
- Both reuse the existing `_ReportPDF` header/footer/pagination engine, so they match the look of the 12 existing reports (inventory, valuation, low stock, transactions, summary, audit, discrepancy, sales, scan invoices, expiring, category performance, barcode labels).

### Added — Move phone units between PCs (safe cross-database merge)
- New **Export / Import phone units** actions in **Admin → Cloud Sync → Actions**. Export dumps all phone units to a portable JSON file keyed by model **name + IMEI** (not internal database IDs); Import re-creates any missing phone models by name and inserts the units, **de-duplicating by IMEI** so it is safe to re-run and never overwrites existing data.
- Purpose: combine a PC that holds the phone units with a PC that holds the master parts/inventory **before** a one-time cloud push, so neither dataset is lost. Backed by `PhoneRepository.export_units()` / `import_units()`.

### Changed — "Stock value" now reflects **cost basis**, not retail price
- The Analytics dashboard **STOCK VALUE** card, the **Stock Valuation**, **Summary** and **Category Performance** PDF reports, and the **Phones** stock-value KPI now value on-hand stock at **cost price** (`cost_price` for parts, `buy_price` for phones), falling back to sell price only when no cost was recorded so the figure is never blank. A separate retail value remains available for parts.
- The per-brand / per-part-type / pivot value breakdowns use the same cost basis, so every "value" figure across the app is now consistent.

### Fixed — Phone detail-table action buttons were clipped
- In the Phones page detail table, the per-row **Edit (✎)** / **Delete (🗑)** icon buttons and the panel's **✕** close button rendered cut off. Root cause: the shared `#mgmt_edit` / `#mgmt_del` style carries `padding: 3px 12px` (sized for text buttons), which left no room for the glyph inside the fixed-size icon buttons. Fixed by overriding the padding/min-size on the icon buttons, centring them, widening the Actions column (76 → 92 px) and giving rows a 34 px height.

### Changed — Full EN / DE / AR translations for every phone feature
- All user-facing strings across the Phones page, Add/Edit Phone dialog, barcode-scan action popup, Sold-Phones history dialog, phone transaction/audit labels, and the Shop Settings **Modules** card are now localised in English, German and Arabic (RTL-aware), matching the rest of the app.

## [2.5.8] - 2026-06-10

### Added — 📱 Phones tab: whole-device inventory tracked by IMEI
- New **Phones** sidebar tab (opt-in per shop) for tracking individual phone units as whole devices by **IMEI**, separate from the parts matrix. Brand × model **stock grid** (storage columns 64 GB–1 TB) with colour-coded counts and a per-model **detail panel** listing every unit, plus KPI cards (total, in stock, sold, avg battery, stock value).
- **Add / Edit Phone** dialog: model, IMEI (with duplicate detection), storage, condition (New / Used / Refurbished), battery %, buy/sell price, status (in stock / sold / reserved) and notes.
- **Barcode labels** for phone units (IMEI / PHN-code) exportable for YunPrint, plus a **scan → Phone action popup** (Stock OUT / Mark Sold, Reserve, Back to Stock, Edit, View) when a unit's barcode is scanned from the header search.
- **Transaction history & Sold-Phones history**: every add / edit / sell / reserve / return / delete is written to a new `phone_transactions` audit log with a denormalised snapshot (readable even after a unit is deleted) and surfaced in a Sold Phones history dialog; status changes support **undo / redo**.

### Added — Cloud Sync across multiple PCs (Turso, no server required)
- New **Cloud Sync** admin panel: enter Turso database URL + token, **Test Connection**, enable sync, choose an interval, **Sync Now**, and **Initialize as Primary / Replica** to choose which PC seeds the shared data. Connectivity uses a pure-stdlib **Turso HTTP pipeline** client (no Rust / embedded-replica dependency), so every repository reads and writes the cloud database unchanged. A header **sync indicator** shows live status.

### Added — White-label module toggle
- A new **Modules** card in Shop Settings makes the Phones tab opt-in per install, so shops that don't sell phones never see it. Requires an app restart to apply.

### Changed — Database schema V21 → V23
- **V22** adds the `phones` table (IMEI-tracked units); **V23** adds the `phone_transactions` audit table. Existing databases upgrade automatically on first launch.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed — `Yellow` (and any Y/Z) barcodes didn't scan on German keyboards
- **User-visible symptom**: iPhone 15 / 15 Plus `Yellow` rows didn't scan — the printed sticker said `…-YL` but the scanner produced `…-ZL`, so the lookup missed.
- **Root cause**: on a German-layout (QWERTZ) machine the physical Y key sits in the US-Z position and vice versa, so a scanner emitting the US-Y HID code produces `Z` through Windows. The DB stored the encoded character (`Y`), which never matched the scanned `Z`.
- **Fix**: symmetric `Y ↔ Z` translation at generation and lookup, plus a **V19 → V20** migration that swaps Y/Z in already-stored barcodes (and `scan_cmd_*` / `scan_clr_*` config rows). Same family as the `+` → `P` (V19) fix.

### Fixed — Slash-bearing barcodes (`12/12 Pro`, `Soft/Hard OLED`) didn't scan
- **User-visible symptom**: combined-model SKUs written `12 / 12 Pro` (one part that fits both iPhone 12 and 12 Pro) and the `Soft/Hard OLED` part type produced barcodes that wouldn't scan, even though every other model scanned fine.
- **Root cause**: the handheld scanner runs in keyboard-wedge mode against a German (QWERTZ) OS layout, so a scanned character is replayed as the US-physical-key scancode and re-interpreted by the German layout. The US `/` key sits where German has `-`, so a printed `/` arrives at the app as `-`. The payload `IP-12/12P-SO` was stored with `/` but every scan produced `-` in that position, so the barcode never matched itself on lookup.
- **Fix**: substitute `/` → `-` at generation (`_make_barcode_text`) and at lookup (`canonical_barcode`) so payloads round-trip cleanly through the same `-` → `ß` path every separator uses, and the print-grade validator now exercises the real payload. New **V20 → V21** migration rewrites already-stored `/` barcodes (and `scan_cmd_*` / `scan_clr_*` config rows) to `-` so labels printed before this change keep scanning. Same family as the existing `+` → `P` (V19) and `Y ↔ Z` (V20) fixes.

## [2.5.6] - 2026-05-12

### Added — Edit and Delete buttons on each sale row
- The sales-history table's actions column now carries **three** icon buttons per row: Receipt (existing), **Edit** (blue, pencil), and **Delete** (red, trash). All three share the original 36×36 styling so the table's visual rhythm is unchanged; the column width grew from 50 → 130 px to fit the trio.
- **Edit** opens `POSDialog` in edit mode (new `edit_sale_id` constructor param). The dialog pre-loads the sale's customer, discount, note, and every line item into the cart, switches the window title to `Edit Sale #N`, and renames the primary action button to `Update Sale`. On accept it routes to the new `SaleService.update_sale` which:
  - Computes a stock-delta per item: `new_qty - old_qty`. Positive delta → more sold → stock down + `OUT` transaction with note `Updated sale #N`. Negative → less sold → stock up + `IN` transaction. Zero → skip (no churn for unchanged lines).
  - Validates BEFORE making any changes: each new line's qty must fit in `current_stock + old_sale_qty` (the old qty is already deducted, so its return forms part of the available pool).
  - Replaces `sale_items` rows + updates the `sales` row in the same connection (atomic).
- **Delete** triggers a confirmation dialog listing every item that will be restored to stock and the sale's net total, then routes to the new `SaleService.void_sale` which:
  - Restores each line's quantity to its item's `stock` (the opposite of `create_sale`'s deduction).
  - Logs a reversal `IN` transaction per line with note `Voided sale #N` — the inventory audit trail keeps BOTH the original `OUT` (`Sale #N`) and the reversal `IN`, so the history of what happened is fully recoverable.
  - Hard-deletes the `sales` row (the existing `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `sale_items` removes its lines automatically).
- The existing `SaleService.delete_sale` (hard delete with NO stock restoration) is kept on the service for internal / admin use, but is **never** wired to the user-facing UI — the row Delete button always calls `void_sale`. This means accidental clicks can't permanently lose stock; the worst case is a sale that gets re-created (the user can simply create a new sale with the same items).
- **Localised** EN / DE / AR: button tooltips, confirmation dialog title/body (with `{id}`, `{items}`, `{currency}`, `{total}` interpolation), success message, and the POS-dialog edit-mode title (`Edit Sale #{id}` / `Verkauf #{id} bearbeiten` / `تعديل البيع رقم {id}`) and primary action (`Update Sale` / `Verkauf aktualisieren` / `تحديث البيع`).
- **No schema change** — uses the existing `sales` and `sale_items` tables. No migration required. KPI cards (count / revenue / average / items sold) recompute on every refresh, so they auto-update after edit / delete.

### Fixed — Matrix search hid colour sub-rows when matching by model name
- **User-visible symptom**: searching for `A33` in the Matrix tab's filter box showed only the model row `Galaxy A33 5G (A336B)` — every colour sub-row underneath (`● Black`, `● Blue`, `● White`, …) was hidden, leaving the matched model orphaned and useless for any per-colour operation.
- **Root cause (data + access)**: each colour sub-row's column-0 text is JUST the colour name — `"      ● Black"` — with no model context. The text filter built a per-row haystack from `current_brand + column_0_text`, so a colour row's haystack was `"samsung ● black"`. A query for `A33` matched the model row's haystack `"samsung galaxy a33 5g"` but not the colour rows', because nothing in the colour rows references the parent model. **Additionally** (the bug a first patch attempt missed): `filter_rows` lives on `FrozenMatrixContainer`, but the model-to-colour mapping dicts (`_color_to_model_row`, `_model_to_color_rows`) live on the wrapped `MatrixWidget` instance — reading them via `getattr(self, …)` from the container returned `{}` and the propagation logic silently no-op'd. Now reads them from `dt` (the inner `MatrixWidget`).
- **Fix**: build a model-to-colour mapping during `MatrixWidget.load()` — track each colour sub-row's parent model row index as the load loop emits them. `filter_rows` does a two-stage text match: stage 1 computes own-text-match per row (existing behaviour), stage 1b propagates between model and its colours — model match → every colour visible (the bug fix), any colour match → parent model visible for context (clean orphan-row prevention). Stock-state chip filter (`Low` / `Out` / `Reorder`) is still evaluated per-row in stage 2.
- **Verified against three query patterns**: `A33` (model-name match) → model + all 3 colours visible. `Black` (single-colour match) → only the Black colour row + its parent model visible. `foo` (no match) → everything hidden.

### Fixed — Product scans hijacked to Quick Scan when a stale session was open
- **User-visible symptom**: scanning ANY barcode — products, part types, anything — navigated to the Quick Scan tab. The scan-action popup never appeared. The user could no longer look up products by scan because every scan got routed to Quick Scan.
- **Root cause**: `MainWindow._barcode` had a condition `is_command(bc) or self._quick_scan_tab._session.mode` that fired the Quick Scan navigation. The second clause was meant to keep an active Quick Scan session absorbing subsequent product scans (the "scan ADD then scan items into cart" workflow). But `_session.mode` stays truthy as long as the session is open, even after the user navigates away from Quick Scan. So a half-finished Quick Scan session silently hijacked every scan from every other tab.
- **Fix**: route to Quick Scan ONLY on the three command barcodes (ADD / DEL / OK). Product barcodes ALWAYS open the scan-action popup on the current tab. The "absorb into Quick Scan session" workflow is preserved by an additional guard: it only fires when the user is **currently on the Quick Scan tab** AND the session is active. Walking away from Quick Scan now restores normal product-lookup behaviour on every other page.

### Fixed — Matrix tab swallowed barcode scans (commands AND product popup never fired)
- **User-visible symptom**: on every page EXCEPT the Matrix tab, scanning a command barcode (CMD-INSERT / CMD-TAKEOUT / CMD-CONFIRM) navigated to Quick Scan and processed the command, and scanning a known product showed the scan-action popup (Stock In / Out / Adjust). On the Matrix tab specifically, NOTHING happened — scans were silently consumed by the matrix table.
- **Root cause**: `BarcodeLineEdit` (the header search field) only receives scanner keystrokes when it has keyboard focus. The Matrix tab transfers focus to its `MatrixWidget` table on activation, so scanner USB-HID keystrokes were routed to the table's `keyPressEvent` (which only handles `Ctrl+D` fill-down and discards other keys) and never reached the header.
- **Fix**: new `GlobalScannerCapture(QObject)` in `app/ui/components/barcode_line_edit.py` — a **deliberately narrow** application-wide event filter that engages **ONLY when a `MatrixWidget` has focus**. When the matrix table owns focus, the filter detects scanner bursts using the same 80 ms inter-key timing heuristic as the existing `BarcodeLineEdit`, swallows the keystrokes (so they don't pollute the table cell), and re-emits via `barcode_scanned` → routes to the existing `MainWindow._barcode` handler. On every other page the filter returns `False` immediately and lets Qt's normal focus chain deliver the keystrokes to the header's BarcodeLineEdit (the existing path). Net effect: matrix scans now work, every other page is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Important lesson learned** (documented inline in the filter so future maintainers don't repeat the mistake): a v2.5.6 dev build cast a wider net here — it intercepted whenever the focused widget wasn't a text-input — which broke the popup on every page because BarcodeLineEdit never got a chance to fire. **Don't generalise focus-stealing detection beyond the specific widget known to steal.** Inventory tables, transactions tables, etc. all leave the header's search bar in the natural focus chain on every page except Matrix, so the BarcodeLineEdit path keeps working there.

### Fixed — iPhone 17 Air payloads overflowed the sticker
- **User-visible symptom**: iPhone 17 Air barcodes "still not scannable, same issue as before" (too long).
- **Root cause**: `_abbreviate("17 Air")` falls through to the generic `len<=4` keep-whole branch for the `"AIR"` token, producing the 5-char model code `17AIR`. Combined with any 3-char part-type (e.g. `OSP` legacy, `DDSO` after override) + colour, that's 15-16 chars / 51.9-54.7 mm — over a 50 mm sticker. Exact same overflow class as the 12/13 mini issue fixed in v2.5.5 with `MINI → M`.
- **Fix**: same pattern — added `"AIR": "A"` to `_WORD_MAP`. The "AIR" token only appears in Apple's Air-suffix products (iPhone 17 Air, iPad Air), no collision with any other line's tokens (Samsung's A-series tokens like `A04` / `A52` are kept whole by the `len<=4` path, unaffected by single-token mapping). Saves 2 chars per Air-model barcode.
- **Verified**: `IP-17A-OS-BK` is now 12 chars / 43.7 mm (was `IP-17AIR-OS-BK` 15 chars / 51.9 mm). All common part-type combos fit with margin. `(D.D) Soft-OLED Diagnose × Air × colour` still flags at 51.9 mm — same DDSOD-on-50 mm overflow accepted in v2.5.4 for backward compatibility with already-printed labels.

### Fixed — V20 migration log crashed under Windows cp1252 console
- **User-visible symptom**: `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '↔'` during the first launch of v2.5.5 on a Windows machine with a cp1252-encoded console. The migration ran correctly (DB ended up at V20, items_swapped=0 since no Y/Z were in the user's data yet) but the error chatter polluted the log.
- **Root cause**: the V20 migration's log message contained the literal Y-LEFT-RIGHT-ARROW-Z character (U+2194), which is outside cp1252's repertoire. Python's `StreamHandler` calls `.encode()` on the stream's native encoding, and Windows console streams default to cp1252 on older terminals.
- **Fix**: replaced the non-ASCII arrow with an ASCII slash — log now reads `Y/Z swap for DE keyboard`. Verified no other `_log.info` / `_log.debug` calls in `database.py` contain non-ASCII characters.

### Notes for the user
- After updating to v2.5.6, the new `GlobalScannerCapture` is active immediately — no migration, no schema bump. Test by scanning a command barcode while on the Matrix tab: it should now jump to Quick Scan and process the command. Scanning a known product should pop the scan-action dialog.
- For the iPhone 17 Air width fix, tick **Regenerate (overwrite existing)** + **Generate** + **Assign & Save** to refresh 17 Air items' codes from `17AIR...` to `17A...`. Reprint stickers for those items only.

## [2.5.5] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed — Y ↔ Z swap on DE keyboards (the actual root cause for "Yellow doesn't scan")
- **User-visible symptom**: a printed barcode reading `IP-15PL-WN-YL` scanned as `IP-15PL-WN-ZL` (`Z` at the end instead of `Y`). DB stored `YL`, scanner produced `ZL`, lookup missed.
- **Root cause**: same family as the existing `-` → `ß` quirk we already adapt to. The DE-layout keyboard puts `Y` and `Z` in **swapped physical positions** vs US-layout (DE is QWERTZ, not QWERTY). USB barcode scanners emit raw HID scancodes assuming US layout; Windows on a DE machine interprets the same scancode through DE layout. Pressing the "US-Y" scancode (HID 0x1C) produces character `Z` on DE; the "US-Z" scancode (HID 0x1D) produces `Y`. So `Y` in a printed barcode comes out as `Z` through the DE OS, and vice versa. Affects every barcode containing `Y` or `Z` — Yellow (`YL`) was the most common case but `Galaxy Z Fold` and similar would have hit it too if they'd ever shipped via this code path.
- **Fix**: same approach as `-` → `ß`. Apply the swap in `_barcode_for_db` so the DB stores the **scanner-output form** (`...ZL` for Yellow), not the printed form (`...YL`). Reverse the swap in `_to_code39` so the encoded image still shows the correct printed text. New `_DE_KEYBOARD_SWAP = str.maketrans("YZyz", "ZYzy")` constant — its own inverse, so the same translation applies in both directions.
- **Migration V19 → V20** runs `swap.translate(YZyz, ZYzy)` over every existing `inventory_items.barcode` and `app_config` command/colour entry containing `Y` or `Z`. One-shot Python loop (SQLite has no built-in TRANSLATE), idempotent within a single run, ignores rows without Y/Z.
- **Verified end-to-end**: generator outputs `IP-15PL-BN-YL` (with `Y`); DB stores `IPß15PLßBNßZL` (with `Z`); simulated DE scanner reading the printed barcode produces `IPß15PLßBNßZL`; lookup matches. `_to_code39` round-trips `IPß15PLßBNßZL` back to `IP-15PL-BN-YL` for image regeneration.

### Fixed — `_color_short` was case-sensitive (silent yellow miscoding)
- **User-visible symptom**: iPhone 15 / 15 Plus Yellow rows printed labels that wouldn't scan, while every other colour for the same models scanned fine. The user's question — "why only yellow" — was the right one.
- **Root cause**: `_color_short` did a case-SENSITIVE dict lookup against `_COLOR_SHORT` (whose keys are Title-Case: `"Yellow": "YL"`). If a colour value came in lower-case, upper-case, or with stray whitespace mid-string, the dict lookup missed and the function fell through to the generic "first two alphanumeric chars, uppercased" fallback. So `"Yellow"` → `"YL"` (correct), but `"yellow"` → `"YE"` and `"YELLOW"` → `"YE"` (both wrong). Same physical colour, two different barcodes whenever the casing flipped between the originally-printed sticker and the regenerated DB entry. Affected EVERY multi-letter colour in the table — Yellow was just the one the user noticed because Apple introduced it as a distinctive new colour for iPhone 15 and the rows got re-edited at some point.
- **Fix**: pre-computed lowercase index `_COLOR_SHORT_LC = {k.lower(): v for k, v in _COLOR_SHORT.items()}` and changed `_color_short(color)` to look up `key.lower()` instead of the raw key. Idempotent, O(1), zero performance impact, dict keys stay Title-Case for documentation legibility.
- Verified against `Yellow` / `yellow` / `YELLOW` / `Yellow ` / ` Yellow` / `Black` / `black` / `BLACK` / `silver` / `SILVER` — all resolve to the same canonical 2-letter code.

### Fixed — iPhone 12 mini / 13 mini Back Cover with NFC overflowed the sticker
- **User-visible symptom**: 12 mini / 13 mini Back Cover (and Back Cover with NFC) labels failed to scan because the printed barcode physically didn't fit the 50 mm sticker. 15 Plus + Back Cover with NFC had the same issue.
- **Root cause**: two compounding factors. First, the `MINI` → `MIN` abbreviation made mini model codes 5 chars (`12MIN`, `13MIN`) — one longer than typical 4-char iPhone codes. Second, the generic `_part_type_code` fallback for `"Back Cover with NFC"` produced `BCWN` (4 chars from word-initials of `BACK`, `COVER`, `WITH`, `NFC`), so the payload `IP-12MIN-BCWN-BK` was 16 chars / 54.7 mm — over a 50 mm sticker by ~5 mm.
- **Fix (two-pronged)**:
  - **`MINI` → `M`** in `_WORD_MAP` (was `"MIN"`). Saves 2 chars on every mini-model barcode, structurally fixing the overflow. The single-letter `M` collides nominally with `MAX` → `"M"`, but `MAX` only appears AFTER `PRO` ("Pro Max" → `PM`), never standalone, so `12M` always reads as "12 mini" and `12PM` as "12 Pro Max" — no real-world collision. Verified across all iPhone / Galaxy models.
  - Added `"back cover nfc": "BN"` to `_PART_TYPE_OVERRIDES` (B = Back, N = Nfc). Catches the cases where the NFC variant on non-mini iPhones (15 Plus, etc.) would otherwise still overflow.
  - Updated `_normalize_pt_name` to strip the filler words `"with"` and `"w/"` so every spelling — `"Back Cover with NFC"`, `"Back Cover w/ NFC"`, `"Back-Cover NFC"`, `"Back Cover NFC"`, `"BACK COVER WITH NFC"` — converges on the same `"back cover nfc"` override key.
- **Verified**: `IP-12M-BN-BK` and `IP-13M-BN-YL` are now 12 chars / 43.7 mm (well inside the 50 mm sticker, with 6 mm margin); `IP-15PL-BN-YL` is 13 chars / 46.4 mm. Existing 4-char-model iPhones (15 Pro Max, 13 Pro Max etc.) unchanged because they don't go through the `MINI` mapping.
- **User action**: tick **Regenerate (overwrite existing)** + **Generate** + **Assign & Save** to refresh the stored codes for any mini-model items, then reprint stickers for those items only.

### Added — "Print Commands Only" sheet
- New **"Print Commands Only"** button on the Barcode Generator page produces a single-page A4 PDF containing just the three Quick-Scan command barcodes (ADD / DEL / OK), big and well-spaced — no item / model rows. Use case: laminate as a permanent reference sheet near the workstation, or tape next to the K30F printer for a shop-floor scan target.
- **Always available** — doesn't require Generate to have been clicked first, because the command barcodes come from `ScanConfig` (the user-configured CMD-INSERT / CMD-TAKEOUT / CMD-CONFIRM strings), not from inventory rows. One click, save, immediate preview in the system PDF viewer.
- **Layout**: portrait A4 with 18 mm outer margins. Each block is one-third of the column height (~73 mm tall) with 16 mm whitespace between blocks. Top of each block is a coloured 14 mm strip carrying the action label (`ADD` blue-grey, `DEL` warm orange, `OK` muted green — matches the colour scheme used in the existing item+command sheet) plus a one-line action description and the underlying scanner text in monospace for visual debugging. The barcode itself fills 80% of the column width centred in the block, sized to ~50 mm tall so it scans at a comfortable distance.
- **Pre-validated** end-to-end: `BarcodeGenService.create_commands_only_pdf` produces a 53 KB single-page PDF; rendered through PyMuPDF + decoded with zxing-cpp returns all three Code 128 commands cleanly (`CMD-INSERT`, `CMD-TAKEOUT`, `CMD-CONFIRM`).
- **Localised** — button label and dialog text in EN / DE / AR (all three locales the rest of the app supports). Filename defaults to `QuickScan_Commands_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf` (or the localised equivalent), sanitised so non-Latin chars in the localised filename can't crash the save dialog.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed — `zxing-cpp` was not bundled with the installer (customer regression in v2.5.3)
- **Symptom**: customer auto-updated to v2.5.3, opened the Barcode Generator → Verify dialog, and saw `"zxing-cpp is not installed — only the width check ran. Install with: pip install zxing-cpp"`. The decode validation that v2.5.1 introduced silently degraded to width-check-only because the lib wasn't on the customer's machine.
- **Root cause**: v2.5.1 made `zxing-cpp` an OPTIONAL dependency via lazy import (`try: import zxingcpp; except ImportError: ...`) — the intent was to fail gracefully if it wasn't installed. But it was never added to `requirements.txt` or the PyInstaller `.spec`, so `installer/build_installer.bat` produced an installer without the lib. The decode check worked in the developer's environment (where `pip install zxing-cpp` had been run manually during v2.5.1 development) but not in any installed-from-installer copy. Asking customers to `pip install` something is a non-starter for a Windows-installer-distributed app.
- **Fix**:
  - Added `zxing-cpp==3.0.0` to `stock-manager/requirements.txt`
  - Added explicit binary bundling in `StockManagerPro.spec` (zxing-cpp ships as a single `.pyd` extension module, not a package directory, so `collect_all` doesn't apply — the spec resolves `zxingcpp.__file__` and adds the `.pyd` path to `binaries` plus the module name to `hiddenimports`)
  - Added a build-time guard in the spec that **raises if `zxingcpp` isn't importable in the build environment** — fails the build loudly so the operator notices BEFORE shipping a half-working installer (the v2.5.3 mistake)
- **Build operator action required**: run `pip install zxing-cpp==3.0.0` once in the dev/build environment, then rebuild via `installer/build_installer.bat`. The spec's import guard will refuse to build if you forget. Customers auto-updating from v2.5.3 → v2.5.4 will get the bundled `.pyd` — no pip required, and their Verify dialog will switch from `541/541 pass (width check only)` to `541/541 pass (decode + width check)`.

### Changed — Reverted `(D.D)` family codes to the pre-v2.5.3 `DDSO` form
- **Why**: the user had already printed and applied physical labels with the legacy `DDSO`-style codes for `(D.D) Soft-OLED` items before v2.5.3 was released. v2.5.3's switch to `DSO`/`DSD` would have broken those existing stickers' DB lookups (different code in DB after regenerate vs. what's printed on the sticker). To avoid forcing a reprint of every applied label, the codes are reverted to the `DD` brand prefix + 2-char product mnemonic + optional `D` diagnose suffix:
  - `(D.D) Soft-OLED`           → `DDSO`     (matches pre-v2.5.3 labels)
  - `(D.D) Soft-OLED Diagn(*)`  → `DDSOD`
  - `(D.D) Hard-OLED`           → `DDHO`
  - `(D.D) Hard-OLED Diagn(*)`  → `DDHOD`
  - `(D.D) OLED`                → `DDOL`
  - `(D.D) OLED Diagn(*)`       → `DDOLD`
- **What's kept from v2.5.3**: `_normalize_pt_name()` lenient matching (every spelling of `Diagn` / `Diagnose` / `Diagnostic` / `Diagnostics` / `Diagnosis` still resolves to one canonical key), and the diagnostic variants now have a UNIQUE code (`DDSOD` ≠ `DDSO`) instead of silently colliding via the pre-v2.5.1 fallback bug.
- **Width trade-off acknowledged**: `IP-15PM-DDSO-BK` is 15 chars (51.9 mm) — 1.9 mm over a strict 50 mm sticker budget. This is the SAME width the user's existing physical labels are at, so it prints fine in their setup; new diagnostic variants (`DDSOD`, 16 chars / 54.7 mm) need either untick-per-color or a slightly wider sticker roll, same as before.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed — `(D.D) Soft-OLED` and `(D.D) Soft-OLED Diagnose` collided on `DDSO`
- **Root cause**: the v2.5.1 `_PART_TYPE_OVERRIDES` table only had three (D.D)-family keys (`"(d.d) soft oled"`, `"(d.d) soft-oled"`, `"(d.d) soft-oled diagn"`). Any spelling variation — `"Diagnose"` instead of `"Diagn"`, space instead of hyphen, or both at once — fell through to the generic 4-char fallback which produces `DDSO` (parens "DD" + word-initials "SO/SOD" trimmed to 4 chars). When a user has both `(D.D) Soft-OLED` (override hit → `DD`) and `(D.D) Soft-OLED Diagnose` (fallback → `DDSO`) the codes are different — but if the user has TWO diagnostic-variants spelled differently (e.g. one with `Diagn`, one with `Diagnose`) they BOTH fall through to the same fallback `DDSO` and silently collide. The user reported both iPhone OLED variants showing the same `DD-SO` code on the sticker.
- **Fix**: introduced `_normalize_pt_name(name)` that aggressively normalises before override lookup — replaces `-` and `_` with spaces, collapses runs of whitespace, and unifies every diagnostic-family word (`diagnose`, `diagnostic`, `diagnostics`, `diagnosis`) to the canonical `diagn`. Override keys are stored in the same normalised form. Verified against 22 plausible spellings: every `(D.D) Soft-OLED` variant resolves to `DSO` (5+ spellings), every `(D.D) Soft-OLED + diagnostic` variant resolves to `DSD` (7+ spellings including `Diagn`, `Diagnose`, `Diagnostic`, `Diagnostics`, `Diagnosis`).
- **Hybrid `D` + 2-char product mnemonic codes** for the entire (D.D) family — picked over abstract `DD`/`DDD` so codes read meaningfully on the sticker:
  - `(D.D) Soft-OLED`           → `DSO`  (D.D + Soft-Oled)
  - `(D.D) Soft-OLED Diagn(*)`  → `DSD`  (D.D + Soft-Diagnose)
  - `(D.D) Hard-OLED`           → `DHO`
  - `(D.D) Hard-OLED Diagn(*)`  → `DHD`
  - `(D.D) OLED`                → `DOL`
  - `(D.D) OLED Diagn(*)`       → `DOD`
- The leading `D` keeps the `(D.D)` brand identity in the code, so a future plain `Soft-OLED` from a different supplier (which falls through to the generic `SO` fallback) doesn't collide. Width: `DSO` is 1 char wider than the old `DD`, but every iPhone payload (4-char model + 3-char part-type + colour = 14 chars at 49.2 mm) still fits the 50 mm sticker comfortably. Verified end-to-end via `_make_barcode_text`.
- **User action required**: tick **Regenerate (overwrite existing)** + **Generate** + **Assign & Save** on the Barcode Generator page to refresh stored codes. Old printed labels still scan against the canonicalised DB rows because the override applies at both write and read time, but stored barcode strings only update via regenerate.

### Fixed — `logs/stock_manager.log` was being tracked in git
- The runtime log file was inadvertently committed across v2.4.7 → v2.5.2 — every release pushed several MB of local log output to GitHub. Untracked the file via `git rm --cached` (file remains on disk and the app keeps writing to it normally) and added `logs/` + `*.log` to `stock-manager/.gitignore` so it can't sneak back in. Historical log content remains in the commit history; a follow-up `git filter-repo` could scrub it if size becomes a concern, but that's a destructive operation we shouldn't run without explicit consent.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed — Scan-to-add round trip ("Galaxy A15 4G doesn't save")
- **Root cause**: `ItemRepository.add_product` and `update_product` stored the barcode argument with only `.strip()` applied — no scanner-mark prefix removal — while `get_by_barcode` always normalised the input via `normalize_barcode`. When a user scanned an unknown barcode, `MainWindow._barcode` passed the **raw** scanner output (e.g. `aSAßA154ßOLßBK`, with the `a` prefix) into `_add_product(preset_barcode=…)`, the dialog set that raw form into the barcode field, and the save wrote `aSAßA154ßOLßBK` to the DB. On the next scan, `get_by_barcode` stripped the `a` prefix and queried `SAßA154ßOLßBK` — which the DB didn't have (it had the prefix-included form). Same barcode, two different stored strings, never matched. The user's intuition that it was "the a at the beginning" was correct. The bug was symptom-free as long as items came in via barcode-generator + Assign & Save (those use the canonical form), which is why it stayed hidden until the user added a model via scan-to-add. **Affects ALL scan-to-add inserts since v2.4.8** (when the V17 migration cleaned legacy data but the write-path wasn't fixed), not just A15.
- **Fix**: introduced `canonical_barcode(text)` in `app/services/barcode_gen_service.py` — the single source of truth for the DB-canonical form — and applied it at every barcode write site (`add_product`, `update_product`, `update_barcode`, `bulk_update_barcodes`) and read site (`get_by_barcode`). Also canonicalised `preset_barcode` in `inventory_ops.add_product` so the dialog shows the user the same string that will actually be stored.
- **Migration V18 → V19** rewrites any existing rows that leaked through the bug since V17 — re-applies the scanner-mark prefix strip (same heuristic as V17) on `inventory_items.barcode` and `app_config` command/colour barcode rows.

### Fixed — Galaxy S10+ printed labels not scannable
- **Root cause**: the K30F + YunPrint Code 128 renderer produces visual artifacts on the `+` character — the user's "lines pushed to other lines" symptom. The encoding is technically valid, but the printed bars overlap into adjacent positions and the resulting sticker fails to decode regardless of payload length (the user reported failure on a 13-char `SA-S10+-OS-BK` payload that should have fit comfortably). Affects every payload that contains `+`: OnePlus brand "1+", PRO+ marker "P+" (Note 14 Pro+, Pixel 6a Pro+, etc.), literal Plus models "S10+", "S20+", "S22+", "Note 10+".
- **Fix**: substitute `+` → `P` in `_make_barcode_text` so the generator never emits `+` in a payload. `1+` (OnePlus brand) becomes `1P`, `P+` (Pro+ suffix) becomes `PP`, `S10+` (literal model) becomes `S10P`. The substitution is also applied symmetrically in `canonical_barcode`, so existing physical labels printed with `+` continue to scan against the canonicalised DB rows after the V19 migration rewrites them — old labels in shop don't have to be re-printed for lookups to keep working.
- **Migration V18 → V19** also runs `REPLACE(barcode, '+', 'P')` on `inventory_items.barcode` and `app_config` so the stored DB rows are P-form. Verified end-to-end: `SA-S10P-OS-BK` (was `SA-S10+-OS-BK`) renders cleanly and decodes 100% in zxing-cpp at K30F-grade settings. Width unchanged (13 chars, 46.4 mm — well inside the 50 mm sticker budget).

### Notes for the user
- After updating to v2.5.2, the V19 migration runs automatically on first launch. No manual action required.
- Existing physical labels printed with `+` continue to scan because `canonical_barcode` substitutes at lookup time. New regenerations produce P-form labels that print without the YunPrint render artifact.
- For new items, the scan-to-add round trip is now correct: scan unknown → "add product" dialog (shows canonical form) → save → re-scan → finds the item.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed — 100% scannable label printer barcodes
- **Root cause**: The K30F is a 203 DPI thermal printer (8 dots/mm = 0.125 mm per dot). Code 39 needs ~16 modules per character + start/stop overhead; an 18-character payload like `XI-NOTE14P+-OSP-SV` requires ≥ 0.25 mm narrow bar to decode reliably, which makes the symbol ~85 mm wide. On a 50 mm sticker, YunPrint silently shrinks bars below the decode floor (down to 0.18-0.20 mm narrow), the 2.5:1 wide:narrow ratio collapses into integer-dot rounding errors, and the scanner can't lock on. Verified empirically with `zxing-cpp` decoding the rendered output: at 0.20 mm narrow, the long Xiaomi payload decodes 0% of the time; at 0.25 mm and above, 100%.
- **Pre-export decode validation** (`BarcodeGenService.validate_scannability`). Every barcode in a batch is now rendered at K30F-grade settings (203 DPI, 0.25 mm narrow bar, 1.0 mm quiet zone, 1-bit B&W threshold to simulate the thermal head's binary output) and decoded back with `zxing-cpp`. Anything that doesn't decode, or whose printed width exceeds the configured sticker width, is reported up to the UI which **refuses to write the CSV** rather than silently exporting unscannable labels. Optional dependency — install with `pip install zxing-cpp`; without it, the width-fit check still runs.
- **Quiet zone calibrated against real K30F output**: validation defaults to 1.0 mm quiet zone instead of ISO/IEC's textbook 2.5 mm. zxing-cpp + the user's handheld scanner decode 100% at 0.5 mm in benchmarks; 1.0 mm leaves a 2-X-dim safety margin without wasting 4 mm of the 50 mm sticker. The post-export instructions tell the user to set their YunPrint template's quiet zone to ≤ 1.0 mm to match — bigger zones in YunPrint will overflow the sticker even when our validator passes. First user feedback on a 1071-entry catalogue: pass rate jumped from 30% (at the old 2.0 mm default) to ~95%, with the remaining ~5% being genuine 15+ char outliers (Galaxy A04S/A05S OLED + colour, Xiaomi Note 14 Pro+ ORG-Service-Pack + colour) that need either a wider sticker roll OR per-colour barcodes off.
- **`BarcodeValidationError`** carries the failed entries, the oversize entries, and the symbology used, so the UI can show a per-entry breakdown ("Redmi Note 14 Pro+ ORG-Service-Pack Silver → 62.2 mm wide, sticker is 50 mm"). The export dialog offers four actions: switch to Code 128, regenerate with shorter abbreviations, untick per-color barcodes (3 chars saved), or print anyway with a clear "may not scan" warning.
- **Code 128 is now the default symbology** (was Code 39). At the same payload, Code 128 is ~40% denser than Code 39 (11 modules per character vs 13-16) and adds a built-in mod-103 checksum that catches print-bleed damage Code 39 can't detect. Switching is a template-only change in YunPrint — the DB barcode value is byte-identical, so existing Code 39 labels stuck on shop items keep working without migration. Code 39 stays available via the Format radio for users with Code-39-only scanner setups.
- **Curated `_PART_TYPE_OVERRIDES` table** (~30 entries) for the most common phone-repair part types — the real width-killer in production data. `OLED` → `OL` (was `OLED`, saves 2 chars), `Battery` → `BT`, `Back Cover` → `BC`, `(D.D) Soft-OLED` → `DD`, `(JK) incell FHD` → `JK`, `ORG Service Pack` → `OSP`, etc. Lookup is case- and whitespace-insensitive; anything not in the table falls through to the generic abbreviation logic, so this is purely additive — won't break codes for part types you haven't curated yet. Empirical impact on a 1071-entry catalogue: brought oversize count from 573 → 328 in one pass.
- **Radio-generation suffix shorthand** in `_WORD_MAP`: `5G` → `5`, `4G` → `4`, `3G` → `3`. The two-letter form pushed `Galaxy A52s 5G + OLED + colour` and `Galaxy A13 4G + ORG-Service-Pack + colour` from a fitting 14 chars to a non-fitting 15 chars (51.9 mm > 50 mm sticker). One-digit form reads back unambiguously given the brand prefix (`SA-A52S5` is "Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G"; `SA-A134` is "Samsung Galaxy A13 4G") and rescued ~300 entries on the user's catalogue. Verified against zxing-cpp: no decode collisions vs the previous form because brand+model+part+colour is still globally unique.
- **`OSP` → `OS`** in the override table for ORG Service Pack (was 3 chars, now 2). This was the last 1-char-over-budget pattern: `XX-MMMMM-OSP-CC` (5-char model + colour) is exactly 15 chars at 51.9 mm, just over the 50 mm sticker; trimming to `XX-MMMMM-OS-CC` brings it to 14 chars at 49.2 mm. Within the part-type slot of a barcode payload the 2-char form is unambiguous (no other override starts with "O" at length 2). On the user's catalogue this rescued the Galaxy A52s 5G / S20 FE / A13 4G × ORG Service Pack × colour variants — ~180 items.
- **`NOTE` → `N`** in `_WORD_MAP`. The Redmi Note 11 / 11 Pro / 12 Pro / 14 Pro+ family and Galaxy Note 10 / 20 Ultra family all carry the 4-letter `NOTE` prefix, which inflates the model code from a fitting 3-char form (`N11`, `N20U`) to a non-fitting 6-7 char form (`NOTE11`, `NOTE20U`). The 1-letter shorthand is unambiguous within a brand prefix — `XI-N14P+` reads back as "Xiaomi Note 14 Pro+", `SA-N20U` as "Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra". Verified no collision with `Nord` (different word, kept whole) or other N-prefixed model lines.
- **Combined catalogue impact**: pass rate climbed from 30% (pre-v2.5.1) → 46.5% (after QZ tuning) → 69.4% (after part-type overrides) → 82.8% (after 5G/4G shorthand) → 86.6% (after OSP shorthand) → **~100%** (after NOTE shorthand). With this round all known failure patterns on the user's 1071-entry catalogue fit a 50 mm K30F sticker at safe density.
- **Tightened part-type fallback length**: `_part_type_code(max_len=4)` (was 5). Caps unrecognised part-type codes at 4 chars so novel terms can't blow the sticker budget. Note: `_abbreviate(max_len=8)` is **kept at 8** — an attempt to drop it to 6 caused a collision regression where `Note 14 Pro+` and `Note 14 Pro` both truncated to `NOTE14`, merging two distinct phones onto the same code; the override table fixes the width problem without sacrificing model identity.
- **"Verify" button** on the Barcode Generator page runs `validate_scannability` against the current entries WITHOUT writing any files — lets users sanity-check a regenerated batch before deciding whether to assign-and-save. Reports per-entry pass/fail with widths, payload preview, and rejection reason.
- **Post-export instructions dialog** now includes a **K30F + YunPrint template settings checklist** tailored to the chosen symbology — narrow bar ≥ 0.30 mm (≥ 0.25 mm absolute minimum), quiet zone ≥ 2.5 mm, bar height ≥ 8 mm, print darkness 70-80%, slow-medium speed. The template settings are the only remaining failure surface once encoding is validated software-side.
- **Module-level documentation** at the top of `barcode_gen_service.py` walks through the K30F failure mode in detail — the dot-pitch math, the ratio-collapse mechanism, the empirical decode floor by symbology, and the user-side checklist. Future maintainers (and future me) can read the why before touching the validation thresholds.

### Fixed — `_item_repo` reference bug on Barcode Generator page
- **The "X items match" live counter was always showing 0** because `_item_repo` was referenced in `BarcodeGenPage._refresh_count` but never imported (the surrounding `try/except Exception` swallowed the `NameError` silently and fell through to the `n=0` path). Added the missing `from app.repositories.item_repo import ItemRepository` and module-level `_item_repo = ItemRepository()`. The counter now updates correctly as the user adjusts brand / category / model / part-type filters, so they can spot a too-broad scope before clicking Generate.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Bulk split labels-print export
- **"Export for YunPrint" now supports splitting** the output into multiple files in one click. After Generate, the Export button opens a small dialog asking how to split:
  - **Single file** (legacy behaviour) — one combined `.txt`
  - **Split by Part Type** (default — most common request) — one file per JK / D.D / ORG-Service-Pack / Battery / etc., so each goes to its own sticker template / roll
  - **Split by Brand** — one file per Apple / Samsung / Xiaomi
  - **Split by Brand + Part Type** — finest granularity
  - **Split by Model** — one file per phone model
- **Professional naming convention**: every file follows `labels-print-<group>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.txt`, with group names sanitised so brand / part-type names with spaces, dots, slashes, or parens become safe filenames on every OS (e.g. `(D.D) Soft-OLED` → `D_D_Soft-OLED`). Generic `labels-print-` prefix (not vendor-specific) so the same files work with any label printer that imports CSV — YunPrint, Brady, NiceLabel, etc. Multiple batches across multiple days can coexist in one folder and Explorer's name-sort gives a clean chronological listing.
- **Verified end-to-end** on a 1071-entry Apple+Samsung+Xiaomi catalogue: split-by-part-type produced 7 files (`OLED` 488 rows, `JK_incell_FHD` 23 rows, etc.), split-by-brand produced 3 files (Apple 95, Samsung 752, Xiaomi 224), split-by-brand-part-type produced 9 files. Empty groups skipped silently — no zero-row files cluttering the folder.
- New `BarcodeGenService.export_for_yunprint_split(entries, output_dir, split_by)` returns `[(path, count), …]` so the UI can show a per-file summary in the success dialog. The legacy `export_for_yunprint` is now a thin wrapper around the same internal `_write_yunprint_csv` helper, so single-file output stays byte-identical to before — no risk of regression on existing workflows.
- Export button on Barcode Generator page opens a split-mode chooser (radio buttons, default Part Type), then the appropriate file/directory picker. Status bar shows `"X rows in N file(s)"` on success and the post-export dialog lists the first 10 generated files plus `"… and N more"` for larger batches; folder opens in Explorer via `QDesktopServices.openUrl` so the user can drag the .txt straight into the YunPrint app.

## [2.4.10] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Matrix tab Excel-like filter + Σ stats
- **Multi-word AND search** in the matrix toolbar — type natural sentences like `samsung galaxy s22 ultra` or `redmi note 14 pro` and every word must appear somewhere in the row's haystack (order doesn't matter, case-insensitive). 150 ms debounce so typing doesn't re-walk the table on every keystroke. **Enter** applies immediately (skip the wait); **Esc** clears the search.
- **Brand-aware smart search**: typing the product line you say out loud — `iphone` / `galaxy` / `redmi` / `pixel` — works even though the model column only shows the model number (`11 Pro` / `S22` / `Note 14`). The filter prepends the section's brand AND its line aliases (Apple→iphone/ipad, Samsung→galaxy/note, Xiaomi→redmi/poco/mi, Huawei→mate/p/nova/y, Honor→magic, Google→pixel, OnePlus→nord) to each row's haystack before matching. Verified end-to-end: `iphone` → 24 Apple matches / 0 elsewhere; `galaxy` → 376 Samsung; `redmi` → 112 Xiaomi; `redmi note 14` → 3 specific matches; `samsung galaxy s22` → 3 specific matches.
- **Live match-count label** next to the search box — `"24 matching rows"` / `"No rows match"` / hidden when the filter is empty. Always-visible feedback so the user knows the filter narrowed correctly without having to count rows.
- **Empty brand sections hide entirely** in multi-brand mode — when zero models in a section match, both the section's `QLabel` header AND its container disappear, instead of a stray "Samsung" header floating over an empty gap.
- **Filter hides BOTH frozen model column AND data table in lockstep** so vertical alignment is preserved — earlier draft only hid the data table, leaving model names visible against blank gaps. Implementation lives on `FrozenMatrixContainer.filter_rows` so it can drive both child tables (`_model_table` + `_table`) atomically.
- **Brand-context fallback**: each `FrozenMatrixContainer` is now tagged with a `_section_brand` attribute (set by `MatrixTab._add_brand_section` / `_reload_brand_container` for multi-brand views, and by the single-brand path on the brand combo selection). The filter uses this when the container has no internal brand-header rows.
- **Empty brand sections are hidden** when every model under them is filtered out — otherwise a "Samsung" header would float over an empty gap. The two-pass walk decides per-model visibility first, then per-brand-header visibility based on whether any model under it survived.
- **Series separators (the 3px coloured stripes between iPhone 11/12/13/14 series, Galaxy S22/S23 series, etc.) hide along with the models on either side**. Earlier draft kept all separators visible "for context" — but with a narrow filter (e.g. `XS`) that left a stack of orphan 3px stripes underneath the single visible row, looking like a striped grey band. Now a separator is only shown if there's a visible model row BOTH before AND after it within the same brand section; orphan stripes hide along with the rows they used to separate.
- **Quick-filter chips** for the four most common stock states — `All` / `Low` (`0 < stock ≤ min`) / `Out` (`stock = 0` with `min > 0`) / `Reorder` (`stock < min`). Single-select; the active chip carries the accent fill. Filters compose with the search box (text AND state).
- **Σ Selection statistics** readout in the toolbar — `Σ count=… sum=… avg=… min=… max=…` updates live as the user drags out a multi-cell selection. Walks the selection's numeric cells (stock / min / sell / cost / total fields), ignores text cells like model names so the average isn't polluted. Hidden for single-cell selection.
- Both the filter and selection stats survive a refresh — `_attach_selection_handlers()` and `_apply_row_filter()` run after every `_apply_refresh`, so a brand-combo change or admin save doesn't lose the user's current filter.
- Implementation: filter only sets row-hidden flags (no widget rebuild — ~1 ms even on a 200-row table); `MatrixWidget.selection_stats()` walks `selectedItems` and pulls displayed values from each cell's `meta` dict.

### Added — Transactions page auto-refresh
- **Transactions history now polls itself every 30 seconds** while the page is visible, so a user who leaves the app open all day still sees recent stock operations land without manually clicking the refresh button. Stops when the user navigates away (saves the DB round-trip every 30 s for as long as they're on a different page) and fires once immediately on `showEvent` so the first paint after a long background period isn't stale.
- **Doesn't disrupt browsing**: the tick is a no-op if `self._offset > 0` (the user clicked "Load more" to view older transactions) OR the vertical scrollbar is more than half a row off the top — both signal active inspection that a silent reload would pull the user away from. Idle users at the top get fresh data; busy users at row 200 keep their place.
- Implementation: `QTimer` parented to the page, started/stopped in `showEvent` / `hideEvent`. Tick calls the existing `_apply_filters` which already runs through the worker pool (debounced by key, async) so the auto-refresh costs nothing on the UI thread.

### Added — Power-user keyboard shortcuts
- **Ctrl+F** — focus the search box from anywhere on the matrix tab. Standard "find" muscle memory.
- **Ctrl+0** / **Ctrl+L** / **Ctrl+O** / **Ctrl+R** — switch to the All / Low / Out / Reorder chip.
- **Esc** in the search box clears the filter (back to no-text).
- **Enter** in the search box applies the filter immediately (skips the 150 ms debounce).

### Fixed
- **Matrix scroll position fully preserved across stock edits — no movement at all.** The earlier draft re-centered the edited model's row via `scrollToItem(..., PositionAtCenter)`; the user wanted absolute zero movement. Removed the `_scroll_to_saved_model` helper entirely and now rely solely on the legacy pixel-exact `_post_apply_refresh` restore (saves the scrollbar's pixel offset before refresh, schedules retried `setValue(target)` via `QTimer` so the layout-timing race against rebuilt rows is handled gracefully). Result: stock edit completes, viewport stays at the exact same Y offset.
- **Removed the pre-filter `clearSelection()` + `setCurrentCell(-1, -1)` calls** I had added for crash hardening — they were the proximate cause of the original "jump to top" bug because Qt scrolls the viewport when the current cell is reset. Only the lightweight `_hover_row` Python attribute reset survives now (no Qt-side effect, no scroll jump).
- **Stack-of-stripes when filter narrows results** — when the user filtered to non-adjacent series (e.g. `Reorder` showing iPhone 11 Pro and 13 Pro max with the entire 12 series hidden between them), my earlier draft showed BOTH the 11→12 boundary AND the 12→13 boundary as separate 3 px stripes back-to-back. Now collapses to **at most ONE separator** between any two consecutive visible models — multi-separator gaps stay hidden because crossing multiple skipped series is itself the visual cue, no need to add divider noise on top.
- **`UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'QToolButton'`** on Matrix tab construction — caused by an inner `from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QToolButton` inside `MatrixTab.__init__` that, due to Python's function-scope rule, made every `QToolButton` reference in the function local even though the use at line 175 came earlier. Moved `QButtonGroup` / `QTimer` to the module-top imports and dropped the redundant inner imports.
- **Crash on filter** caused by stale current-cell selection landing on a now-hidden row — Qt's `currentCellChanged` signal fires when the current row is hidden, which can cascade into hover-delegate paths that don't expect to be repainted at that moment. `_apply_row_filter` now clears every container's selection AND resets the hover-row index BEFORE running `filter_rows`, then triggers a viewport repaint to flush any stale hover ghost. Defensive `RuntimeError` guards everywhere so the timer-driven walk survives a tab navigation that destroys widgets mid-iteration.
- Quick-filter chips, Σ stats label, and match-count label all re-style themselves on theme toggle via `MatrixTab.apply_theme`.

### Performance
- **`setUpdatesEnabled(False)` wrapper** around the row-hide loop in `FrozenMatrixContainer.filter_rows` — flushes ONE final repaint at the end instead of N during the walk. Verified: 100 filter operations across 3 brand containers (500+ total rows) complete in 858 ms total = ~9 ms per operation. Fast typing in the search box feels instant; no per-keystroke flicker even on the 376-row Samsung container.
- Stress test: 50 random fuzz iterations (random query strings + random chip switches) → **zero exceptions, zero crashes**.

## [2.4.9] - 2026-04-29

Big release bundling barcode-generator overhaul, performance round 1+2, comprehensive theme-system fix, and a new scan-action popup. Each section below is self-contained — read the bits relevant to what you're touching.

### Added — Scan-action popup
- **Header-bar barcode scan now opens a `ScanActionDialog` for known items** instead of navigating to the inventory page and selecting the row. The popup shows item identity (display name, barcode in monospace, stock/min/price stat cards) plus a colour-coded status badge (`IN STOCK` / `LOW STOCK` / `OUT OF STOCK`) so a shop assistant can read the state from across the room. Three primary action buttons close the dialog with the matching signal — **Stock In** (green), **Stock Out** (red), **Adjust** (orange, exact-value entry) — wired to the same `stock_ops.ctx_stock_op` controller every other entry point uses, so the qty-entry / undo-push / summary-refresh chain stays consistent. Secondary row: **Edit** (opens the existing edit dialog) and **Cancel**. Default focus on **Stock In** — most common op when scanning incoming inventory from a delivery.
- **Unknown-barcode flow preserved** — still asks "Add new product?" with the scanned barcode pre-filled. Only known-item scans switch to the popup.

### Added — Barcode Generator
- **Per-color direct-scan barcodes** (`BRAND-MODEL-PT-COLOR`, e.g. `SA-S22U-DSP-BK`) alongside the legacy two-step "scan model -> scan colour" flow. Both coexist; user picks per-batch via the new "Include per-color barcodes (direct scan)" checkbox. `BarcodeEntry` carries a `color` field; `ScanSession.process_barcode` short-circuits the wait-for-colour state when a colour barcode resolves directly to a coloured row.
- **Brand filter combo + live "X items match" count** on the Barcode Generator page. Brand narrows every scope (All / Category / Model / Part Type). Count is a single `COUNT(*)` (`ItemRepository.count_items_for_scope`) recomputed on every filter change.
- **"Regenerate (overwrite existing)" checkbox** — recomputes saved codes from current model + part-type names. Useful after renaming a part type ("ORG-Service-Pack-SM" -> "ORG Service Pack" leaves saved codes stuck on the old name; tick this and Generate to refresh). Implies "Include items with existing barcodes" — auto-ticks and locks the dependency.
- **Model picker auto-narrows to the selected brand** — by-model scope no longer scrolls through 100 mixed-brand models when a brand is chosen.

### Changed — Barcode Generator
- **Async generation pipeline split into Stage 1 / Stage 2**:
  - Stage 1 (DB fetch + entries, ~300 ms) runs on Generate; lights up Assign & Save and Export for YunPrint immediately.
  - Stage 2 (PDF assembly via fpdf2 + PyMuPDF preview rasterisation, 20-30 s on a 2000-item batch) only runs on first Export PDF / Print click.
  - YunPrint export workflow (`Generate -> Export for YunPrint -> drop into YunPrint Database`) is now ~1 s end-to-end instead of ~30 s. The PDF was rendered eagerly even when the user only wanted the .txt.
- **Professional encoding across all brands**. Legacy `X-NOTE1-SMOR-SV12` -> new `XI-NOTE14P+-OSP-SV`:
  - Brand: 2-letter codes via `_BRAND_SHORT` (Apple->IP, Samsung->SA, Xiaomi->XI, Redmi->RD, Huawei->HW, Honor->HO, OPPO->OP, Vivo->VI, Realme->RM, OnePlus->1+, Google->GO, Nokia->NO, Motorola->MO, Sony->SO, LG->LG). Two-letter fallback for unknown brands.
  - Model: `_abbreviate` max_len 5 -> 8; word map gains `PRO+`->`P+`, `LITE`/`FOLD`/`FLIP`/`EDGE`/`NEO`. "Note 14 Pro+" -> `NOTE14P+` instead of truncated `NOTE1`. Strips additional brand-line prefixes (`POCO `, `MI `, `PIXEL `, `HONOR `, `NOTHING `).
  - Part type: new `_part_type_code` extracts parenthesised tags as prefix (`(JK)`->`JK`, `(D.D)`->`DD`) and uses word initials for the rest (`ORG Service Pack`->`OSP`, `(JK) incell FHD`->`JKIF`). Single-word PTs get first 4 letters so "Battery"->`BATT`.
  - Collision suffix: `f"{base}-{suffix}"` separator (`...-SV-2` instead of glued `...-SV2` that read as "Silver-2").
  - **Affects new barcodes only**. Existing items keep saved codes unless the new Regenerate checkbox is ticked.
- **YunPrint export format**: `.txt` with RFC-4180 CSV (UTF-8 BOM, `csv.writer` `QUOTE_MINIMAL`). YunPrint's Excel importer silently rejected openpyxl `.xlsx`; tab-TSV was read as one oversized column because YunPrint's segmentation defaults to comma.

### Performance — Database
- **4 hot-path indexes via V17 -> V18 migration**: `phone_models(brand)`, `part_type_colors(part_type_id)`, `model_part_type_colors(model_id, part_type_id)` composite, `inventory_transactions(item_id, timestamp DESC)` covering. `ANALYZE` after migration so the planner picks them up immediately. Indexes also baked into the DDL for fresh installs.
- **`_ensure_all_entries` smart-skip via fingerprint** (`_matrix_fingerprint`): hashes (count, max(updated_at)) over the 5 contributing tables, cached in `app_config.matrix_fingerprint`. Idempotent calls drop **221 ms -> 0.08 ms (2700x)**. Saves ~200 ms on every startup and admin-save where nothing actually changed.
- **`_ensure_all_entries` batched DELETEs**: pre-fetch stale-colour candidates once, queue IDs, flush as one `DELETE ... WHERE id IN (?, ...)` chunked at 500 IDs. Cleanup pass at the end uses `executemany` instead of N round-trips.
- **`bulk_update_barcodes` -> `executemany`**: one round-trip per batch instead of one per row (~50x on 100-item batches).
- **PRAGMA tuning**: `cache_size` 20 MB -> 32 MB, new `mmap_size = 128 MB` so SQLite memory-maps the DB on read-heavy paths.
- **`InventoryItem` -> `@dataclass(slots=True)`**: ~40 % per-instance memory drop, marginally faster attribute access. Real win on the inventory page where 2871 items are materialised every refresh.
- **`reorder` methods** (`ModelRepository.reorder`, `CategoryRepository.reorder` / `reorder_part_types`) switched to `executemany` — was per-row UPDATE inside a Python loop.

### Performance — Repositories
- **Process-wide caches** for the read-mostly methods called dozens of times per session:
  - `ModelRepository.get_brands()`: 300 us -> **0.4 us cached (750x)**. Invalidated by `add` / `delete` / `rename` / `reorder`.
  - `CategoryRepository.get_all_active()`: ~5 ms -> **0.3 us cached (15000x)**. Invalidated by 10 mutation methods (categories + part types + colours). The single biggest win on page-switch latency since every category combo hits this.
  - Both caches use a `threading.Lock` (worker threads read concurrently with UI-thread mutations) and return defensive copies so callers can't poison the cache.

### Performance — UI
- **Barcode generation runs on the worker pool** instead of the UI thread. The legacy `_generate` chain (DB fetch -> image render -> PDF assemble -> preview rasterise) all blocked the UI thread; a 2000-item category froze the app for 30-60 s. Now the user keeps using the app while it runs.
- **Matrix widget zoom path**:
  - Stop concatenating QSS (`mtx.setStyleSheet(self.styleSheet() + body_qss)` made the rule blob grow on every zoom). Replace, don't append.
  - Cap data-cell font-metrics measurement to a 100-row sample (was every row x every column = ~7000 calls per zoom).
  - Skip no-op `setRowHeight` calls (every Qt setRowHeight triggers a layout invalidation even when the height didn't change).
- **Matrix tab models filter**: items unchecked in Part Type Settings are removed from the matrix entirely instead of leaving "disabled" empty rows. `ItemRepository.get_matrix_items` filters out `(model, pt)` combos with the `__EXCLUDED__` marker; matrix tab also drops models that have no remaining items in any displayed part type.

### Fixed — Theme System
- **`ThemeManager` promoted to `QObject` with a `changed` signal**. The legacy `set_theme` only re-applied QSS to `_targets[0]`, leaving every other registered widget (dialogs, popups, settings panels) silently ignored. Now applies to the full `_targets` list AND emits `changed` so widgets that captured `tk.tX` colours at construction can re-read from `THEME.tokens` and refresh.
- **`MainWindow._refresh_theme`** connected once to `THEME.changed`. Walks the widget tree from the main window root, calls `apply_theme()` on every descendant that defines one (lazy-loaded pages too — `findChildren(QWidget)` reaches them through their stack-widget parent), targeted polish on sidebar / header / footer (which use dynamic-property selectors that need explicit re-polish). Replaces the legacy manual fan-out in `_toggle_mode` so every code path that switches themes (toggle button, admin Settings dialog, programmatic API) goes through the same single refresh.
- **`THEME.warm_cache()` scheduled on idle** after `window.show()` — pre-generates QSS for all four themes (`pro_dark` / `pro_light` / `dark` / `light`) so the first toggle dispatches in **< 1 ms** instead of paying ~80 ms to build the QSS string.
- **`apply_theme()` added to widgets that bake `tk.X` colours at construction**, discovered automatically by the widget-tree walk:
  - `LanguageSwitcher._TriggerButton` — pill background / border / label colours.
  - `MatrixWidget` — brand-header rows + separator rows tracked at load, repainted in place via `setBackground` (~1 ms vs ~100 ms full rebuild).
  - `MatrixTab` — full re-render against the cached worker payload (`self._last_payload`). Rebuilds KPI cards, brand-section header QLabels in the all-brands view, every data cell. No DB hit. Eye icon (cost-mode toggle) re-applies `_apply_cost_toggle_style` with current `COST_VIS.visible` state.
  - All-brands view's brand-section header `QLabel` (built by `_add_brand_section`) gets a closure-based `apply_theme` attribute that rebuilds its inline stylesheet against current tokens.
  - `ProductDetailBar` — 17 inline styles refactored into a single `_apply_styles()` method called from both `_build()` and `apply_theme()`. Local headers + separators saved as `self.*` so the refresh path can reach them.
  - `SummaryCard` — every standalone instance is now self-refreshing (was previously refreshable only via `DashboardWidget`'s private `_cards` dict, so KPI tiles owned by Audit / Reports / etc. stayed stuck).
  - `AuditListView` — title / subtitle labels saved as `self.*` and refreshed via a centralised `_apply_header_styles`.
  - `PivotTable` (Valuation Pivot) — re-runs `_render()` against cached `self._data`, covering all four sub-classes' 46 inline-style call sites in one pass.

### Fixed — Other
- **Barcode lookup survives scanner-mark prefix differences**. Pre-V17 the system hardcoded a leading `f` on every saved barcode; real-world testing on the K30F + YunPrint combo emitted `a` instead. Now the DB stores barcodes canonically (no prefix) and lookup paths strip whatever lowercase prefix the scanner emits before matching, via `normalize_barcode()`. V16 -> V17 migration strips legacy prefixes from `inventory_items.barcode` and `app_config.value` (for `scan_cmd_*` / `scan_clr_*` keys).
- **Part-type panel Models & Colours table shows every brand by default**, not just the alphabetically-first one. New Brand: dropdown above the table; brand-header rows separate each brand's models in "All brands" mode. Auto-detect-by-most-items SQL removed.
- **`requirements.txt`** declares `openpyxl==3.1.5` explicitly (already imported by `export_service.py` / `import_service.py` but missing from the file, so fresh installs / PyInstaller builds were missing it).

### Removed
- Legacy manual `unpolish/polish` fan-out in `_toggle_mode` (eight separate loops). Replaced by the single signal-driven walk in `_refresh_theme`.

## [2.4.8] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Barcode lookup now survives scanner-mark prefix differences** — pre-V17 the system hardcoded a leading lowercase ``f`` on every saved barcode (e.g. ``fAß11PMßJKIN``) because that's what the original developer's German-keyboard scanner emitted as a "scanner mark" before each scan. Real-world testing on the K30F + YunPrint combo revealed the scanner emits a *different* lowercase letter (``a``) when reading YunPrint-rendered Code 39 instead of python-barcode-rendered Code 39, so DB lookups against ``f...`` rows missed every scan from a YunPrint-printed label. Going forward the DB stores barcodes in their canonical (prefix-less) form and lookups strip whatever lowercase letter the scanner happens to emit, so old PDF prints, new YunPrint prints, and any future renderer all match the same DB row.
  - New `normalize_barcode()` helper in `barcode_gen_service.py` — strips a single leading ASCII a-z when followed by an uppercase letter or digit (canonical payloads always start with brand letter / digit, never another lowercase letter, so the rule is unambiguous). Idempotent.
  - `_barcode_for_db()` no longer prepends ``f`` — returns the canonical (prefix-less) form.
  - `_to_code39()` uses `normalize_barcode()` so it accepts ``f...``, ``a...``, or no-prefix input identically.
  - `ItemRepository.get_by_barcode()` normalises input before the DB query.
  - `ScanConfig.is_command()`, `command_type()`, `is_color_barcode()`, `color_name()` all normalise both sides of the comparison so command/color barcodes also stop caring which scanner mark the hardware emits today.
- **Schema migration V16 → V17 — strip scanner-mark prefix from existing rows.** Updates `inventory_items.barcode` and `app_config.value` (for `scan_cmd_*` and `scan_clr_*` keys) to drop a leading lowercase letter when followed by an uppercase or digit. Runs once on first launch after upgrade. Heuristic-safe — only touches rows that match the scanner-mark pattern and leaves anything else untouched.

## [2.4.7] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **YunPrint export format — switched from `.xlsx` to RFC-4180 CSV (`.txt`)** so YunPrint's Database dialog actually parses the file. The 2.4.5 implementation wrote an openpyxl `.xlsx` and instructed the user to import via Excel mode; live testing on the K30F revealed YunPrint's Excel parser silently rejects openpyxl-generated workbooks (Sample-data preview empty, field-binding dropdown empty), and the tab-delimited fallback was read as a single oversized column because YunPrint's `.txt` mode defaults to `Character Segmentation: Comma` and doesn't auto-detect tabs. Final format is comma-separated, UTF-8-BOM, written via Python's `csv.writer` with `QUOTE_MINIMAL` — YunPrint parses out the six columns (`barcode`, `model`, `part_type`, `model_full`, `brand`, `label`) cleanly and the user can bind each template field to a single column from the dropdown.
  - File extension stays `.txt` (matches the YunPrint Database mode that actually works on the K30F + Dlabel driver combo).
  - The how-to dialog shown after export now reflects the `.txt` Database mode flow rather than the broken Excel mode flow.
  - `openpyxl` import is removed from `BarcodeGenService.export_for_yunprint`. The dep stays in `requirements.txt` because `export_service.py` and `import_service.py` still use it for general Excel I/O.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Part Type Settings — Models & Colors table now shows every brand, not just one.** Previously, when selecting a part type (especially a brand-new one with no inventory yet), the table only displayed models from a single auto-detected brand: the brand with the most existing items, or — for a fresh part type — the brand that came first alphabetically. Every other brand was invisible, so users couldn't tick/untick across the full catalogue without dropping to the database.
  - Default scope is now **All brands**, with brand-header rows separating each brand's models in the table.
  - New **Brand:** dropdown (All brands · Apple · Samsung · …) at the top of the Models & Colors card lets the user narrow the scope when a single brand has too many models. Selection is preserved across part-type changes within the same session.
  - Brand-header rows use the existing `model_id == -1` placeholder convention, so the include/exclude checkbox handler and double-click color-edit handler skip them automatically — no risk of accidentally toggling/editing a header.
  - The auto-detect-by-most-items logic that picked a single brand has been removed entirely; the user is in control via the dropdown.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Export for YunPrint (K30F label printer support)** — new "Export for YunPrint" button on the Barcode Generator page. Generates an `.xlsx` workbook one-row-per-barcode that YunPrint/Dlabel can import via its **Database** dialog (Excel mode, "first line contains the field name"). Once a 50×20mm template is designed once with template fields bound to `Database`, every future batch is: Generate → Export for YunPrint → in YunPrint click Database → pick the file → Print all. One print job for the whole batch — no per-label clicking.
  - **Same Code39 strings** already saved on items go straight into the `barcode` column, so labels printed by the K30F scan identically to the existing app barcodes — no regeneration, no migration.
  - Columns exported: `barcode`, `model` (compact brand-prefixed form like "IP 11 Pro Max" / "SA S25 Ultra"), `part_type`, `model_full` (full original "iPhone 11 Pro Max"), `brand`, `label`. The user picks whichever fits their template.
  - Brand short codes (`IP`/`SA`/`XI`/`HW`/...) live in `_BRAND_SHORT` in `barcode_gen_service.py` with a 2-letter fallback for unknown brands.
  - Skips command/color scanner barcodes — those are scanner-only and don't belong on per-item stickers.
  - After save, opens the containing folder in Explorer and shows a one-shot how-to dialog so the user knows the YunPrint import flow without leaving the app.
  - Reuses the existing scope selector on the Barcode Generator page (All / Category / Model / Part Type) — same scope produces the YunPrint xlsx and the legacy A4 PDF.

### Changed
- **`requirements.txt`** — declares `openpyxl==3.1.5` explicitly. The dep was already imported by `export_service.py` and `import_service.py` but had been missing from the requirements file, so fresh venvs / PyInstaller builds were missing it. The new YunPrint export uses it too. No runtime change for environments where it was already installed transitively.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Part Type Settings — unchecking a model now removes it from the matrix instead of leaving a "disabled" empty row.** Previously, unchecking a model in Admin → Part Types only set an `__EXCLUDED__` marker in `model_part_type_colors` and pruned zero-stock inventory rows; rows with stock/min_stock/inventur stayed in the DB and continued to render in the matrix as "—" cells, producing a confusing half-removed look.
  - `ItemRepository.get_matrix_items` now joins against `model_part_type_colors` with a `NOT EXISTS` filter, so any (model, part_type) combo carrying the `__EXCLUDED__` marker is dropped from the result regardless of stock state. Existing data is preserved — re-checking the model in Part Type Settings restores the rows exactly as before.
  - `MatrixTab._apply_refresh`, `_add_brand_section`, and `_reload_brand_container` now filter the `models` list to only those that have at least one item left in `item_map`. A model that has been excluded from every part type its brand previously had inventory in vanishes from the matrix entirely instead of rendering as an empty row.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-21


## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Shop setting: "Show sell totals in matrix"** — new checkbox in Admin → Shop Settings (Regional card, under UI Scale). When off, the matrix TOTAL column and the value portion of the per-part-type cards + the grand-total card are hidden, so shop assistants see stock counts without seeing sell valuation. Units stay visible either way. Cost mode (PIN-gated via 👁) overrides the hide so the cost/sell comparison still makes sense when the owner has authenticated.
  - Persisted via `ShopConfig.show_sell_totals` (reuses the existing `app_config` key-value mechanism — no DB migration needed).
  - Typed accessor `ShopConfig.is_show_sell_totals`.
  - Default is ON — existing users see zero change until they toggle it off.
  - Live-update on Save: the existing settings-close rebuild chain (`ShopConfig.invalidate()` → `rebuild_matrix_tabs()` fast path → `tab.refresh()`) propagates the new state to every matrix tab instantly.

### Fixed
- **Float-precision display bug** — `7 × 22.99` was rendering as `€160.9299999999998` in matrix TOTAL cells and cards. `ShopConfig.format_currency` used `str(amount)` which exposed the full Python-float representation. Now formats with `f"{float(amount):,.2f}"` — always exactly 2 decimals, thousands separator included. One-line fix at source means every money display across the whole app (matrix cells, cards, Quick Scan, Sales, POS, Analytics, Reports, Purchase Orders) benefits automatically.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
#### Lazy UI construction — startup & settings-close no longer freeze

- **`NavController.register_lazy(key, page_index, factory, on_activate)`** — new API. The factory runs on first navigation; a lightweight `QWidget` placeholder holds the stack slot until then. `register_placeholder(page_index)` + `realize(key)` + `get_lazy_instance(key)` complete the contract.
- **`_MatrixPlaceholder`** — matrix category tabs are now placeholders until the user clicks their sidebar entry. On first click `NavController._go_matrix` swaps the placeholder for a real `MatrixTab` in the same stack slot, emits `navigated`, then kicks the first `refresh()` via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` so the switch paints before the DB round-trip lands.
- **10 static pages migrated to lazy**: `SalesPage`, `CustomersPanel`, `PurchaseOrdersPage`, `ReturnsPage`, `BarcodeGenPage`, `ReportsPage`, `SuppliersPage`, `AnalyticsPage`, `AuditPage`, `PriceListsPage`. Each has a closure-style factory that sets `self._xxx_page` before returning; the `AnalyticsPage` factory also wires `navigate_to.connect(nav_ctrl.go)` after construction. Eager pages (`InventoryPage`, `TransactionsPage`, `QuickScanTab`) stay immediate.
- **`AsyncRefreshMixin`** (new `app/ui/workers/async_refresh.py`) — single contract for pages/tabs: `self.async_refresh(fetch, apply, key_suffix, debounce_ms)`. Keyed cancellation, `_is_alive()` guard using `sip.isdeleted`, error-path falls through to a non-blocking `_show_empty_state` instead of a modal. Baked into `BaseTab` so every matrix tab inherits it.
- **UI-thread watchdog** (new `app/ui/workers/ui_watchdog.py`) — opt-in via `SM_UI_WATCHDOG=1`. A 10 ms `QTimer` stamps `time.monotonic()`; a daemon thread warns whenever the main thread hasn't heartbeat in > 50 ms. Zero cost when disabled. Regressions that put sync DB calls back on the UI thread show up instantly in the logs.
- **Grand-total card** at the end of the matrix cards strip — emerald-accent anchor showing total units and total valuation across every part-type in the current filter. Metric tag flips `sell` ↔ `cost` with the admin toggle, exactly like the per-part-type cards.

### Performance

- **Worker pool hardening** (`app/ui/workers/worker_pool.py`) —
  - Epoch-based stale-result guard: every `submit(key, …)` bumps a per-key monotonic epoch; result / error callbacks are gated by the captured epoch so a late signal carrying stale data is silently dropped even if the cancel-event check missed it.
  - `POOL.has_pending(key)` helper so callers can coordinate with in-flight critical workers.
  - `POOL.shutdown(timeout_ms)` — called from `MainWindow.closeEvent`; cancels all work, stops debounce timers, `waitForDone()` the underlying `QThreadPool`. No more leaked workers on exit.
  - Callback error containment: exceptions inside `on_result` / `on_error` are logged instead of silently killing the signal chain.

- **Settings-close freeze — fully resolved.** `ensure_matrix_entries` (can touch 1000+ rows) now runs on `POOL` keyed `"admin:matrix_ensure"`. The admin dialog returns **instantly**. The worker's `on_result` on the main thread does the pure-widget rebuild (`rebuild_matrix_tabs` → fast-path, `apply_theme_to_matrix_tabs`, `_retranslate`, `nav_ctrl.go(saved)`). `on_error` fallback still rebuilds so the user never gets a stuck UI on a DB hiccup.

- **`rebuild_matrix_tabs` fast path** — if the active-category set hasn't changed (the common case on settings close), existing realised tabs are KEPT intact and just marked `_dirty=True`; the currently-visible tab gets a refresh via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)`. Previously rebuild unconditionally nuked every realised tab into a placeholder, leaving the user looking at an empty page for a moment. Only true category adds/removes/reorders take the slow path and recreate placeholders.

- **`MatrixTab.refresh()`** fully async — every DB query (`get_matrix_items`, `get_all`, `get_brands`) runs off the UI thread via `POOL.submit`. In all-brands mode this replaced up to 12 synchronous repo hits per refresh with one pooled fetch; the UI thread no longer touches the DB during brand-combo changes, cost-toggle flips, or post-edit refreshes. `_add_brand_section` / `_reload_brand_container` accept pre-fetched `models=` / `item_map=` kwargs so the worker feeds every brand section at once.

- **Matrix lazy refresh** — per-category `POOL_KEY_PREFIX` (`f"matrix_{category_key}"`) so keys never collide between tabs. Each tab has a `_dirty` flag; on `COST_VIS.changed`, only the currently visible tab refreshes immediately, others flip `_dirty=True` and reconcile on their next `showEvent`. No more stampede of 5-6 parallel DB queries every time the 👁 button is clicked.

- **`ProductTable.load()`** — replaced per-row `setRowHeight(i, 48)` loop with a single pre-loop `verticalHeader().setDefaultSectionSize(48)`. The per-row call triggered a layout recalc even with `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` — saves 400-600 ms of startup UI-thread work for a 300-item inventory.

- **Per-page async conversions** —
  - `SalesPage._load_products` + `_refresh` split into worker-fetch + UI-thread `_apply_sales` / `_render_products`. Keys: `"sales_products"`, `"sales_refresh"`.
  - `PurchaseOrdersPage._refresh` combined `po_repo.get_all` + `po_repo.get_summary` into one `POOL.submit_debounced("po_refresh", …, 150)` and applied via `_apply_po_data`.
  - `AuditPage._load_data` combined `get_all_audits` + `get_summary` into one pooled fetch; KPIs + table render in `_apply_audits` on the main thread.

- **`AnalyticsPage.__init__`** — inline `self.refresh()` deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, self.refresh)` so widget-tree construction completes before the skeleton paint + 5 POOL workers fire. Combined with lazy construction, analytics costs nothing until the user actually opens the page.

- **`StartupController._on_ok`** — removed the eager `analytics_page.refresh()` call now that analytics is lazy. Saved 200-400 ms of skeleton-paint + worker dispatch at startup for a page the user may never open.

### Fixed

- **Blank matrix tab after settings close** — root cause was a `POOL.has_pending("admin:matrix_ensure")` guard inside `MatrixTab.refresh()`. Qt dispatches slots in connection order, so user callbacks fire **before** the pool's own `_cleanup` slot; the guard incorrectly returned `True` inside the very callback that was triggered by result delivery. Guard removed (WAL handles concurrent reads safely); the fast-path `refresh()` in `rebuild_matrix_tabs` is now deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` so it runs on a clean event-loop idle tick.
- **Silent matrix refresh failures** — `MatrixTab.refresh()`'s `POOL.submit` now has an `on_error` handler that logs the failure with the category key. No more invisible worker exceptions leaving a page blank.
- **`ProductTable.setRowHeight` in loop** — per-row call triggered layout recalcs that `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` couldn't suppress. Moved to `defaultSectionSize` once before the loop.

### Changed

- Matrix staggering experiment reverted — staggering brand sections across ticks via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` opened race windows where a second refresh mid-chain left the page blank. Correctness > 200 ms of visual smoothness: `_apply_refresh` builds all sections inline.
- `MainWindow.closeEvent` now calls `POOL.shutdown(2000)` for graceful worker drain.

---

## [2.3.10] - 2026-04-21

### Added
#### Cost valuation — PIN-gated matrix redesign
- **`cost_price` column** on `inventory_items` — purchase / buy price, persisted per item. Schema V16 migration adds the column automatically on first launch.
- **Matrix columns bumped 5 → 7** per part-type group: `MIN-STOCK · DIFFERENCE · STOCK · ORDER · SELL · COST · TOTAL`.
  - **SELL** = the previous "PRICE" column renamed for clarity (item.sell_price with part-type default fallback; edit flow unchanged).
  - **COST** = new, shows `item.cost_price` in the shop's accent blue. **Hidden by default** — only shown after the owner toggles it.
  - **TOTAL** = always visible. Metric flips with the cost toggle:
    - Default: `stock × effective_sell_price`
    - Admin mode: `stock × cost_price`
  - Cell tooltip clarifies which metric is active ("Stock × sell = …" / "Stock × cost = …").
- **👁 cost-visibility toggle** in every matrix tab toolbar. Click prompts for `ShopConfig.admin_pin` (if configured, via `QInputDialog` password-echo — same pattern as `open_admin`). Button swaps closed-eye ↔ talking-eye icon and shows a green accent border when active. One flip fans out to every matrix tab via `CostVisibility.changed`.
- **Professional per-part-type cards** at the top of every matrix tab (name · total units · total valuation · `sell`/`cost` suffix). Live metric — switches from sell-based → cost-based totals when the toggle is on. Card strip lives inside a restored collapsible `BRAND & LEGEND` section alongside the brand filter row.
- **Editable cost_price** — double-click a COST cell (admin mode only) opens the same numeric dialog pattern used for sell; full Undo/Redo via `ItemRepository.update_cost_price()`.
- **Currency symbol everywhere** — SELL, COST, TOTAL cells + tooltips format through a new `_fmt_money()` helper backed by `ShopConfig.format_currency()`.

### New services / repos
- `app/services/cost_visibility.py` — session-local `COST_VIS` singleton (`QObject` with `changed` signal). Default `visible=False` on every app start — nothing persists, so sensitive valuation never leaks on an unattended laptop.
- `ItemRepository.update_cost_price(item_id, new_cost)` — new write method; `_build()` reads `cost_price` when the column exists.
- `_type_visible_width(table, ti)` helper in `matrix_widget.py` — sum of *visible* column widths for a part-type group, so banner chips never over-stretch when the COST column is hidden.
- `_SUB_MIN / _SUB_BB / _SUB_STOCK / _SUB_ORDER / _SUB_SELL / _SUB_PRICE / _SUB_TOTAL` sub-column constants — arithmetic across the matrix now self-documents.

### Performance — professional worker-pool overhaul

- **Pool hardening** (`app/ui/workers/worker_pool.py`) —
  - Epoch-based stale-result guard: every `submit(key, …)` bumps a per-key monotonic epoch; result and error callbacks are gated by the captured epoch, so a late signal carrying stale data is silently dropped even if the cancel-event check missed it.
  - New `POOL.has_pending(key)` helper so callers can skip a refresh while a critical worker (e.g. `admin:matrix_ensure`) is still writing.
  - New `POOL.shutdown(timeout_ms)` that cancels everything, stops debounce timers, and `waitForDone()` the underlying `QThreadPool`. Called from `MainWindow.closeEvent` — no more leaked workers on exit.
  - Callback-error containment: exceptions inside `on_result` / `on_error` handlers are now logged instead of swallowing the signal stream.

- **`AsyncRefreshMixin`** (new `app/ui/workers/async_refresh.py`) — single contract every page/tab now follows:
  - `self.async_refresh(fetch=…, apply=…, key_suffix=…, debounce_ms=…)`
  - Auto-cancels prior task via `POOL` keyed as `f"{POOL_KEY_PREFIX}:{key_suffix}"`.
  - `_is_alive()` guard using `sip.isdeleted` so callbacks skip deleted widgets (tab closed mid-load, language rebuild, etc.).
  - Error path falls through to `_show_empty_state(msg)` inline, not a modal — no more freezing on an error dialog.
  - Baked into `BaseTab` so every matrix tab and future tab gets it for free.

- **Startup freeze — resolved** —
  - `MainWindow._build_ui` defers `rebuild_matrix_tabs()` via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)`; the main window paints and becomes interactive before any DB work.
  - On first-run setup, `ensure_matrix_entries()` (can touch 1000+ rows) runs on a `POOL` worker; the widget rebuild runs in the `on_result` callback on the main thread.

- **Settings-close freeze — resolved** —
  - Admin-dialog close now submits `ensure_matrix_entries` to `POOL` keyed `"admin:matrix_ensure"`. The dialog returns instantly. The worker's `on_result` on the main thread does the pure-widget rebuild (`rebuild_matrix_tabs`, `apply_theme_to_matrix_tabs`, `_retranslate`, `nav_ctrl.go(saved)`).
  - `on_error` fallback still rebuilds tabs so the user never gets a stuck UI on a DB hiccup.
  - `MatrixTab.refresh()` early-returns when `POOL.has_pending("admin:matrix_ensure")` — prevents mid-write reads and sets `_dirty=True` so the tab reconciles on its next `showEvent`.

- **Matrix lazy refresh** —
  - Every `MatrixTab` now has a `_dirty` flag. On `COST_VIS.changed`, only the **currently visible** tab refreshes immediately; others flip the flag and reconcile on their next `showEvent`. No more stampede of 5-6 parallel DB queries when the 👁 button is clicked.
  - Each `MatrixTab` uses a per-category `POOL_KEY_PREFIX` (`f"matrix_{category_key}"`) so keys never collide between parallel tabs.

- **Per-page migrations off the UI thread** —
  - `SalesPage._load_products` + `SalesPage._refresh` — both split into worker-fetch + UI-thread `_apply_sales` / `_render_products`. Keys: `"sales_products"`, `"sales_refresh"`.
  - `PurchaseOrdersPage._refresh` — `po_repo.get_all` + `po_repo.get_summary` combined into a single `POOL.submit_debounced("po_refresh", …, delay_ms=150)` and applied via `_apply_po_data`.
  - `AuditPage._load_data` — `get_all_audits` + `get_summary` combined into one pooled fetch; KPIs + table render in `_apply_audits` on the main thread.

- **UI watchdog** (new `app/ui/workers/ui_watchdog.py`) —
  - Opt-in dev diagnostic enabled via `SM_UI_WATCHDOG=1`.
  - A 10 ms `QTimer` on the UI thread stamps `time.monotonic()`; a daemon thread polls every 50 ms and logs a warning whenever the stamp is older than a configurable threshold (default 50 ms). Instantly surfaces any regression that puts a sync DB call back on the UI thread.

### Fixed
- Banner chip widths now align correctly with the visible columns when the COST column is hidden (previously over-stretched by one column-width).
- `UnboundLocalError: QScrollArea` on `MatrixTab.__init__` — a nested `from PyQt6.QtWidgets import … QScrollArea` shadowed the module-level import; removed the duplicate.
- Duplicate `BRAND:` label (collapsible section header + filter row) — section header restored to `BRAND & LEGEND` and now wraps both cards + filter together.
- Matrix banner reverted to a slim 30 px name-chip after totals moved to the top card strip; banner keeps column-grouping context without duplicating data.

### Changed
- Matrix edit dialogs for price split into **Sell Price** and **Cost Price** with distinct titles / Undo labels.
- Cost edit instant-repaints the clicked COST cell + neighbouring TOTAL cell synchronously before the DB refresh lands, so the whole edit lands in a single visual frame. SELL edit does the same for TOTAL when not in cost mode.
- Schema version bumped **15 → 16**.

## [2.3.9] - 2026-04-20

### Added
#### Pricing · Quick Scan · Invoices
- **Part-type default price** — Admin → Part Types now has a "Default price" field. Every item inheriting the part type takes that price; per-item `sell_price` still overrides. New "PRICE" column in the part-type admin table.
- **€ / Price column in the matrix** — new column per part type. Green when a per-item override exists, grey when falling back to the part-type default. Double-click to edit; Ctrl+Z undoes.
- **Quick Scan live pricing & totals** — pending table now shows **Unit Price** and **Line Total** per scanned line + a totals card with **ITEMS · SUBTOTAL · GRAND TOTAL** (accent green, JetBrains Mono). Currency formatted via `ShopConfig.format_currency`.
- **Customer field on Quick Scan** — optional input; printed on the invoice when present, otherwise a walk-in record.
- **PDF invoices on every commit** — confirming a scan asks **A4 invoice** or **Thermal receipt**, persists the header + line items, and writes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StockPro\StockManagerPro\invoices\INV-YYYYMMDD-NNNN.pdf`. Feed row shows an **Open** button. TAKEOUT → "INVOICE"; INSERT → "STOCK RECEIPT". Layout preference remembered via QSettings.
- **New `ScanInvoiceService`** (A4 + 80 mm thermal fpdf2 layouts) and **`InvoiceRepository`** (day-prefixed numbering + price snapshot per line).

#### Reports — full overhaul
- **5 new reports**: Stock Valuation (per part type, category subtotals, grand total), Sales (with top-10 best sellers), Scan Invoices (IN/OUT history with filter), Expiring Stock (urgency-coloured), Category Performance (stock + movement per category).
- **Inventory report** now groups by **Category → Part Type** with per-section subtotals, a Brand column, and a grand-total emerald bar at the end.
- **Date range picker** on the reports page — presets (Today · 7d · 30d · 90d · This year · Custom) + `QDateEdit` from/to pickers. Applied to every date-aware report.
- **Operation filter** — contextual for Transactions (IN/OUT/ADJUST/CREATE) and Scan Invoices (ALL/IN/OUT).
- **Output path + three actions** — status bar shows the saved PDF path with **Open PDF**, **Open folder** (selects file in Explorer), **Copy path**.
- **`_ReportPDF.header() / footer()` overrides** — shop banner, title subtitle, and `Page X of Y` footer render on **every page** (not just page 1) via `alias_nb_pages()`.
- **Logo support** — `ShopConfig.logo_path` is rendered top-left of every report header when the file exists.
- **Per-table pagination** — every table redraws its column headers on a new page when rows cross the bottom margin.

#### Analytics — professional dashboard
- **Top date-range bar** — Today · 7d · 30d · 90d · Year · Custom, with automatic previous-period comparison.
- **Executive KPI row** — 4 tiles (Stock Value · Revenue · Transactions · Low Stock) each with a trend sparkline, ▲/▼ delta badge vs the previous equal-length period, and click-to-drill-down.
- **Brand-separated Valuation section** — Brand chips row at the top, then one card per brand containing category-grouped part-type rows with **share-of-brand** progress bars, category subtotals, and a brand subtotal strip. Bottom: gradient emerald Grand Total.
- **Valuation filter bar** — Brand combo + Category combo + "Clear filters" button. Active-filter badge shows how many filters are applied; grand total note shows the active filter context.
- **Sales section** — revenue trend dual-line chart with previous-period ghost overlay, mini-KPIs (sales count · units sold · avg basket · best day), top sellers + top customers HBars with currency formatting.
- **Stock movement section** — IN vs OUT dual-line chart, busiest-hours HBar, colour-coded recent activity feed.
- **Scan invoices section** — 4 KPIs (count · IN total · OUT total · avg), daily IN/OUT dual-line, top-invoice-customers HBar.
- **New UI components** — `KpiTile` (label + sparkline + delta + click), `DeltaBadge` (▲/▼ pill), `SkeletonBlock` (animated shimmer), `EmptyState` upgraded (icon + retry button), `PivotTable` redesigned as brand-separated valuation, `DualLineChart` (current + ghost overlay + hover tooltip).
- **`AnalyticsService` facade** — one class computes every tile's data block, safe to run on worker threads; tiles load independently via `POOL.submit` and swap skeletons for content as each block completes.
- **Drill-down navigation** — click KPI tile, pivot row, or brand chip → navigates to the filtered Inventory / Sales / Transactions page.

### Schema
- **V15 migration** — adds `part_types.default_price` (REAL, nullable) + two new tables `scan_invoices` and `scan_invoice_items` for invoice records, with indexes on date and invoice_id.

### New architecture
- **Repository helpers**: `ItemRepository.get_value_by_brand / get_value_by_part_type / get_value_pivot`; `TransactionRepository.get_daily_aggregates / get_hourly_aggregates`; `SaleRepository.revenue_daily / top_customers`; `InvoiceRepository.get_totals / get_daily / get_top_customers`.
- **`ScanSessionService.commit(layout, customer_name)`** — snapshots each line's price to `scan_invoice_items` so historical invoices stay stable even if prices change later.
- **`PendingScanItem`** — gains `unit_price` (captured at scan time) and a `line_total` property.
- **`HBarChart.set_data(..., value_format=callable)`** — optional formatter so chart values render with the shop currency (`€12,340.00`) instead of bare integers.

### Fixed
- **Discrepancy report crash** — added missing `_GRAY_700` / `_GRAY_100` colour constants and implemented the missing `_safe()` sanitiser. PDFs render without `NameError` / `AttributeError`.
- **Column overflow on inventory + transaction reports** — widths re-balanced so columns sum to exactly 186 mm (usable page width).
- **Missing page numbers / orphaned continuation pages** — fixed by header/footer overrides.
- **Reports now save to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StockPro\StockManagerPro\reports\`** — same tree used by invoices and backups (was `%TEMP%`).
- **Valuation pivot ambiguous column bug** — renamed the SQL alias to `brand_name` to avoid clashing with `phone_models.brand` / `inventory_items.brand`, then GROUP BY on the full expression.
- **Brand attribution in reports** — every report resolver now falls back through `model_brand → brand → "(no brand)"`; matrix items no longer show as "(no brand)".
- **Analytics valuation scope** — includes zero-stock brand/part-type combos so the full inventory scope is visible (no more "only Apple and Samsung"); grand total unaffected since zeros add nothing.

### Changed
- **Transaction report** accepts a date range + operation filter (was hardcoded to 30 days with no op filter).
- **Backward-compatible analytics refresh API** — `_fetch_all_data` + `_apply_all_data` still exist so `main_window`'s existing `POOL.submit("analytics_refresh", …)` continues to work; the new implementation forwards to `refresh()` on the main thread.

## [2.3.8] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Content-aware column widths** — every table column now sizes to `max(proportional_target, header_text_fit, widest_cell_fit)` at the active font, so headers and model names are ALWAYS fully visible at any zoom level. Applied to matrix, inventory, transactions, and admin tables.
- **Per-item font scaling** — matrix items with individual `setFont` (`_FONT_MODEL` 11pt, `_FONT_COLOR` 9pt, `_FONT_BRAND` 12pt, `_FONT_DATA` 10pt, `_FONT_MONO` 11pt) now scale correctly via a new `BASE_PT_ROLE` marker that remembers each item's 100% point size
- **Real-time live zoom on slider drag** — every slider tick applies zoom through the 16 ms coalescer; drag feels instant with no lag

### Changed
- **Only the active tab is re-zoomed** on slider changes — previously all 6 matrix tabs were iterated every tick (~15 000 items rebuilt per drag step). Inactive tabs catch up lazily when the user navigates to them via `matrix_tab.refresh()`.
- **QFont cache keyed by (family, weight, base_pt)** — a typical matrix has ~1000 items but only ~5 unique font variants; reusing the cached `QFont` instances drastically reduces allocations during zoom
- **Widget-level QSS on QHeaderView** — overrides app-wide `font-size: 11px` and `padding: 10px 16px` so programmatic `setFont` actually takes effect; header height scales with the font + proportional vertical padding
- **Footer zoom widget fully locked** — every child (slider, buttons, preset, divider) uses `Fixed/Fixed` size policy with `setFixedSize`; preset button is `setFixedSize(56, 22)` so percentage text changes ("50%" ↔ "200%") never shift the layout

### Fixed
- **Table headers disappearing at low zoom** — caused by app-wide QSS overriding per-table `setFont`; now overridden with widget-level stylesheet so headers render at the actual scaled font
- **Model names clipped** — column now measures widest model cell using that cell's own scaled font, not the widget default
- **Footer zoom group stretching during drag** — every inner widget locked to `Fixed` size policy and the group itself pinned to a fixed total width
- **Zoom slider lag** — live-drag now handled via a 16 ms coalescing timer in `ZoomService` plus visible-tab-only dispatch; slider release commits synchronously

---

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Professional table zoom** — `ZoomService` singleton drives footer-slider zoom for data tables only: matrix tabs (Displays, Batteries, Cases, …), inventory product table, transaction table, and every QTableWidget inside admin panels. Clean separation from app-chrome sizing.
- **Redesigned footer zoom widget** — zoom-out button + slider with tick marks at every preset + zoom-in button + preset dropdown (50/75/100/125/150/200 + Fit + Reset) + reset button; grouped in a bordered pill with proper QToolButton hover/pressed states
- **Zoom persistence** — table zoom saved to `ShopConfig.zoom_level`, restored on launch; 500ms debounced save so slider drags don't hit the DB
- **UI Scale admin setting** — new dropdown in Shop Settings → Regional & Display: Small (85%), Normal (100%), Large (115%), Extra Large (130%). Controls overall app chrome size (sidebar, header, footer, base font). Restart required — shows a dialog confirmation on change.
- **Slimmer sidebar default** — base width reduced from 240 px → 192 px for a more professional look; UI Scale enlarges it if the user prefers

### Changed
- **Zoom scope limited to tables** — sidebar, header, footer, dashboard KPI cards, analytics charts no longer respond to the footer zoom slider (by design — use UI Scale for chrome sizing)
- **Truly proportional table scaling** — removed arbitrary font floors (9pt body / 8pt header); minimum 6pt for genuine shrinking at 50% zoom. Column widths, row heights, padding all scale via `ZOOM.scale(base, minimum)` — no hard floors fighting the zoom
- **Zoom shortcuts centralised** — Ctrl+=, Ctrl++, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0, Ctrl+Scroll all route through `ZoomService` so footer + shortcuts + wheel stay in sync
- **Matrix refresh preserves zoom** — after refresh, containers re-apply current zoom factor directly (no round-trip through main window)

### Fixed
- **Header truncation at low zoom** — eliminated by proportional column/padding scaling and lower font floor
- **Zoom reset on tab refresh** — matrix tabs now re-apply zoom to all rebuilt brand containers unconditionally

---

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Undo/redo UI freeze** — undo and redo operations now run on the worker pool instead of the main thread, so the window stays fully responsive during the operation
- **Undo/redo real-time refresh** — after an undo/redo, the currently visible tab (inventory, matrix, transactions, analytics) now refreshes in place; you no longer need to switch tabs and come back to see the changes
- **Undo/redo button responsiveness** — undo/redo buttons re-enable immediately after the DB operation completes, before the view refresh; chained undos feel instant
- **Header truncation at low zoom** — header labels (`MIN-VORRAT`, `BESTELLUNG`, `DIFFERENZ`, `BESTAND`) now stay fully visible when zooming out; column widths measured against the new font and padded with a generous 48px buffer

### Changed
- **Thread-safe undo commands** — all undo/redo command lambdas are now DB-only (no UI calls from worker threads); main-thread refresh handled centrally in `_on_undo_done`
- **Inventory filter on undo** — debounce disabled for the post-undo refresh so the product table updates instantly

---

## [2.3.5] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Per-brand matrix sections** — "All Brands" view shows separate sections per brand, each with its own correct part-type columns; outer scroll with full-sized sections and sticky headers
- **No Colors option** — "No Colors" button in color picker removes all colour variants for a model, keeping only the base product
- **Expanded colour palette** — added Red, Pink, Yellow, Orange to available colours in settings and matrix picker

### Fixed
- **Brand display cleanup** — Samsung/Xiaomi no longer show Apple-only part types (stale inventory rows cleaned on startup)

---

## [2.4.3] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Shop setting: "Show color totals in matrix"** — new checkbox in Admin → Shop Settings (Regional card, under "Show sell totals"). When off, the per-color sub-rows hide their SELL / COST / TOTAL cells (rendered as `—`, not editable), so valuation is only shown on the model summary row. Useful when all color variants share the same price — the per-color repeats are just noise. Persisted via `ShopConfig.show_color_totals` (reuses `app_config`, no migration). Typed accessor `ShopConfig.is_show_color_totals`. Default ON — existing layouts unchanged until toggled.
- **Color picker on aggregate stock edits** — when a model has color variants, double-clicking STOCK on the model summary row now pops a "Choose Color" dialog (listing the variants of that model × part-type). Previously the edit silently landed on whichever sibling was returned first (usually White), because the parent row's meta held `any_item.id` — a real bug that let stock ops overwrite the wrong color. Uses `ItemRepository.get_colored_siblings`.

### Changed
- **Sell / cost price edits on aggregate rows propagate to all color variants.** Editing SELL or COST on the model summary row of a colored model now writes the new price to every sibling in one pass, with a single bundled undo entry (`Sell <model>·<part> all colors → X` / `Cost … all colors → X`). The prompt title gains a "(all colors)" suffix and a trailing note so it's obvious what's about to happen. Single-color (non-aggregate) edits keep the previous per-item behaviour. Rationale: in practice variants of the same model share pricing — editing one and not the rest was a common source of drift.

### Fixed
- **Aggregate stock edits no longer silently hit the wrong color.** See the color-picker note above.

---

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Shop setting: "Show sell totals in matrix"** — new checkbox in Admin → Shop Settings (Regional card, under UI Scale). When off, the matrix TOTAL column and the value portion of the per-part-type cards + the grand-total card are hidden, so shop assistants see stock counts without seeing sell valuation. Units stay visible either way. Cost mode (PIN-gated via 👁) overrides the hide so the cost/sell comparison still makes sense when the owner has authenticated.
  - Persisted via `ShopConfig.show_sell_totals` (reuses the existing `app_config` key-value mechanism — no DB migration needed).
  - Typed accessor `ShopConfig.is_show_sell_totals`.
  - Default is ON — existing users see zero change until they toggle it off.
  - Live-update on Save: the existing settings-close rebuild chain (`ShopConfig.invalidate()` → `rebuild_matrix_tabs()` fast path → `tab.refresh()`) propagates the new state to every matrix tab instantly.

### Fixed
- **Float-precision display bug** — `7 × 22.99` was rendering as `€160.9299999999998` in matrix TOTAL cells and cards. `ShopConfig.format_currency` used `str(amount)` which exposed the full Python-float representation. Now formats with `f"{float(amount):,.2f}"` — always exactly 2 decimals, thousands separator included. One-line fix at source means every money display across the whole app (matrix cells, cards, Quick Scan, Sales, POS, Analytics, Reports, Purchase Orders) benefits automatically.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
#### Lazy UI construction — startup & settings-close no longer freeze

- **`NavController.register_lazy(key, page_index, factory, on_activate)`** — new API. The factory runs on first navigation; a lightweight `QWidget` placeholder holds the stack slot until then. `register_placeholder(page_index)` + `realize(key)` + `get_lazy_instance(key)` complete the contract.
- **`_MatrixPlaceholder`** — matrix category tabs are now placeholders until the user clicks their sidebar entry. On first click `NavController._go_matrix` swaps the placeholder for a real `MatrixTab` in the same stack slot, emits `navigated`, then kicks the first `refresh()` via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` so the switch paints before the DB round-trip lands.
- **10 static pages migrated to lazy**: `SalesPage`, `CustomersPanel`, `PurchaseOrdersPage`, `ReturnsPage`, `BarcodeGenPage`, `ReportsPage`, `SuppliersPage`, `AnalyticsPage`, `AuditPage`, `PriceListsPage`. Each has a closure-style factory that sets `self._xxx_page` before returning; the `AnalyticsPage` factory also wires `navigate_to.connect(nav_ctrl.go)` after construction. Eager pages (`InventoryPage`, `TransactionsPage`, `QuickScanTab`) stay immediate.
- **`AsyncRefreshMixin`** (new `app/ui/workers/async_refresh.py`) — single contract for pages/tabs: `self.async_refresh(fetch, apply, key_suffix, debounce_ms)`. Keyed cancellation, `_is_alive()` guard using `sip.isdeleted`, error-path falls through to a non-blocking `_show_empty_state` instead of a modal. Baked into `BaseTab` so every matrix tab inherits it.
- **UI-thread watchdog** (new `app/ui/workers/ui_watchdog.py`) — opt-in via `SM_UI_WATCHDOG=1`. A 10 ms `QTimer` stamps `time.monotonic()`; a daemon thread warns whenever the main thread hasn't heartbeat in > 50 ms. Zero cost when disabled. Regressions that put sync DB calls back on the UI thread show up instantly in the logs.
- **Grand-total card** at the end of the matrix cards strip — emerald-accent anchor showing total units and total valuation across every part-type in the current filter. Metric tag flips `sell` ↔ `cost` with the admin toggle, exactly like the per-part-type cards.

### Performance

- **Worker pool hardening** (`app/ui/workers/worker_pool.py`) —
  - Epoch-based stale-result guard: every `submit(key, …)` bumps a per-key monotonic epoch; result / error callbacks are gated by the captured epoch so a late signal carrying stale data is silently dropped even if the cancel-event check missed it.
  - `POOL.has_pending(key)` helper so callers can coordinate with in-flight critical workers.
  - `POOL.shutdown(timeout_ms)` — called from `MainWindow.closeEvent`; cancels all work, stops debounce timers, `waitForDone()` the underlying `QThreadPool`. No more leaked workers on exit.
  - Callback error containment: exceptions inside `on_result` / `on_error` are logged instead of silently killing the signal chain.

- **Settings-close freeze — fully resolved.** `ensure_matrix_entries` (can touch 1000+ rows) now runs on `POOL` keyed `"admin:matrix_ensure"`. The admin dialog returns **instantly**. The worker's `on_result` on the main thread does the pure-widget rebuild (`rebuild_matrix_tabs` → fast-path, `apply_theme_to_matrix_tabs`, `_retranslate`, `nav_ctrl.go(saved)`). `on_error` fallback still rebuilds so the user never gets a stuck UI on a DB hiccup.

- **`rebuild_matrix_tabs` fast path** — if the active-category set hasn't changed (the common case on settings close), existing realised tabs are KEPT intact and just marked `_dirty=True`; the currently-visible tab gets a refresh via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)`. Previously rebuild unconditionally nuked every realised tab into a placeholder, leaving the user looking at an empty page for a moment. Only true category adds/removes/reorders take the slow path and recreate placeholders.

- **`MatrixTab.refresh()`** fully async — every DB query (`get_matrix_items`, `get_all`, `get_brands`) runs off the UI thread via `POOL.submit`. In all-brands mode this replaced up to 12 synchronous repo hits per refresh with one pooled fetch; the UI thread no longer touches the DB during brand-combo changes, cost-toggle flips, or post-edit refreshes. `_add_brand_section` / `_reload_brand_container` accept pre-fetched `models=` / `item_map=` kwargs so the worker feeds every brand section at once.

- **Matrix lazy refresh** — per-category `POOL_KEY_PREFIX` (`f"matrix_{category_key}"`) so keys never collide between tabs. Each tab has a `_dirty` flag; on `COST_VIS.changed`, only the currently visible tab refreshes immediately, others flip `_dirty=True` and reconcile on their next `showEvent`. No more stampede of 5-6 parallel DB queries every time the 👁 button is clicked.

- **`ProductTable.load()`** — replaced per-row `setRowHeight(i, 48)` loop with a single pre-loop `verticalHeader().setDefaultSectionSize(48)`. The per-row call triggered a layout recalc even with `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` — saves 400-600 ms of startup UI-thread work for a 300-item inventory.

- **Per-page async conversions** —
  - `SalesPage._load_products` + `_refresh` split into worker-fetch + UI-thread `_apply_sales` / `_render_products`. Keys: `"sales_products"`, `"sales_refresh"`.
  - `PurchaseOrdersPage._refresh` combined `po_repo.get_all` + `po_repo.get_summary` into one `POOL.submit_debounced("po_refresh", …, 150)` and applied via `_apply_po_data`.
  - `AuditPage._load_data` combined `get_all_audits` + `get_summary` into one pooled fetch; KPIs + table render in `_apply_audits` on the main thread.

- **`AnalyticsPage.__init__`** — inline `self.refresh()` deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, self.refresh)` so widget-tree construction completes before the skeleton paint + 5 POOL workers fire. Combined with lazy construction, analytics costs nothing until the user actually opens the page.

- **`StartupController._on_ok`** — removed the eager `analytics_page.refresh()` call now that analytics is lazy. Saved 200-400 ms of skeleton-paint + worker dispatch at startup for a page the user may never open.

### Fixed

- **Blank matrix tab after settings close** — root cause was a `POOL.has_pending("admin:matrix_ensure")` guard inside `MatrixTab.refresh()`. Qt dispatches slots in connection order, so user callbacks fire **before** the pool's own `_cleanup` slot; the guard incorrectly returned `True` inside the very callback that was triggered by result delivery. Guard removed (WAL handles concurrent reads safely); the fast-path `refresh()` in `rebuild_matrix_tabs` is now deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` so it runs on a clean event-loop idle tick.
- **Silent matrix refresh failures** — `MatrixTab.refresh()`'s `POOL.submit` now has an `on_error` handler that logs the failure with the category key. No more invisible worker exceptions leaving a page blank.
- **`ProductTable.setRowHeight` in loop** — per-row call triggered layout recalcs that `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` couldn't suppress. Moved to `defaultSectionSize` once before the loop.

### Changed

- Matrix staggering experiment reverted — staggering brand sections across ticks via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)` opened race windows where a second refresh mid-chain left the page blank. Correctness > 200 ms of visual smoothness: `_apply_refresh` builds all sections inline.
- `MainWindow.closeEvent` now calls `POOL.shutdown(2000)` for graceful worker drain.

---

## [2.3.10] - 2026-04-21

### Added
#### Cost valuation — PIN-gated matrix redesign
- **`cost_price` column** on `inventory_items` — purchase / buy price, persisted per item. Schema V16 migration adds the column automatically on first launch.
- **Matrix columns bumped 5 → 7** per part-type group: `MIN-STOCK · DIFFERENCE · STOCK · ORDER · SELL · COST · TOTAL`.
  - **SELL** = the previous "PRICE" column renamed for clarity (item.sell_price with part-type default fallback; edit flow unchanged).
  - **COST** = new, shows `item.cost_price` in the shop's accent blue. **Hidden by default** — only shown after the owner toggles it.
  - **TOTAL** = always visible. Metric flips with the cost toggle:
    - Default: `stock × effective_sell_price`
    - Admin mode: `stock × cost_price`
  - Cell tooltip clarifies which metric is active ("Stock × sell = …" / "Stock × cost = …").
- **👁 cost-visibility toggle** in every matrix tab toolbar. Click prompts for `ShopConfig.admin_pin` (if configured, via `QInputDialog` password-echo — same pattern as `open_admin`). Button swaps closed-eye ↔ talking-eye icon and shows a green accent border when active. One flip fans out to every matrix tab via `CostVisibility.changed`.
- **Professional per-part-type cards** at the top of every matrix tab (name · total units · total valuation · `sell`/`cost` suffix). Live metric — switches from sell-based → cost-based totals when the toggle is on. Card strip lives inside a restored collapsible `BRAND & LEGEND` section alongside the brand filter row.
- **Editable cost_price** — double-click a COST cell (admin mode only) opens the same numeric dialog pattern used for sell; full Undo/Redo via `ItemRepository.update_cost_price()`.
- **Currency symbol everywhere** — SELL, COST, TOTAL cells + tooltips format through a new `_fmt_money()` helper backed by `ShopConfig.format_currency()`.

### New services / repos
- `app/services/cost_visibility.py` — session-local `COST_VIS` singleton (`QObject` with `changed` signal). Default `visible=False` on every app start — nothing persists, so sensitive valuation never leaks on an unattended laptop.
- `ItemRepository.update_cost_price(item_id, new_cost)` — new write method; `_build()` reads `cost_price` when the column exists.
- `_type_visible_width(table, ti)` helper in `matrix_widget.py` — sum of *visible* column widths for a part-type group, so banner chips never over-stretch when the COST column is hidden.
- `_SUB_MIN / _SUB_BB / _SUB_STOCK / _SUB_ORDER / _SUB_SELL / _SUB_PRICE / _SUB_TOTAL` sub-column constants — arithmetic across the matrix now self-documents.

### Performance — professional worker-pool overhaul

- **Pool hardening** (`app/ui/workers/worker_pool.py`) —
  - Epoch-based stale-result guard: every `submit(key, …)` bumps a per-key monotonic epoch; result and error callbacks are gated by the captured epoch, so a late signal carrying stale data is silently dropped even if the cancel-event check missed it.
  - New `POOL.has_pending(key)` helper so callers can skip a refresh while a critical worker (e.g. `admin:matrix_ensure`) is still writing.
  - New `POOL.shutdown(timeout_ms)` that cancels everything, stops debounce timers, and `waitForDone()` the underlying `QThreadPool`. Called from `MainWindow.closeEvent` — no more leaked workers on exit.
  - Callback-error containment: exceptions inside `on_result` / `on_error` handlers are now logged instead of swallowing the signal stream.

- **`AsyncRefreshMixin`** (new `app/ui/workers/async_refresh.py`) — single contract every page/tab now follows:
  - `self.async_refresh(fetch=…, apply=…, key_suffix=…, debounce_ms=…)`
  - Auto-cancels prior task via `POOL` keyed as `f"{POOL_KEY_PREFIX}:{key_suffix}"`.
  - `_is_alive()` guard using `sip.isdeleted` so callbacks skip deleted widgets (tab closed mid-load, language rebuild, etc.).
  - Error path falls through to `_show_empty_state(msg)` inline, not a modal — no more freezing on an error dialog.
  - Baked into `BaseTab` so every matrix tab and future tab gets it for free.

- **Startup freeze — resolved** —
  - `MainWindow._build_ui` defers `rebuild_matrix_tabs()` via `QTimer.singleShot(0, …)`; the main window paints and becomes interactive before any DB work.
  - On first-run setup, `ensure_matrix_entries()` (can touch 1000+ rows) runs on a `POOL` worker; the widget rebuild runs in the `on_result` callback on the main thread.

- **Settings-close freeze — resolved** —
  - Admin-dialog close now submits `ensure_matrix_entries` to `POOL` keyed `"admin:matrix_ensure"`. The dialog returns instantly. The worker's `on_result` on the main thread does the pure-widget rebuild (`rebuild_matrix_tabs`, `apply_theme_to_matrix_tabs`, `_retranslate`, `nav_ctrl.go(saved)`).
  - `on_error` fallback still rebuilds tabs so the user never gets a stuck UI on a DB hiccup.
  - `MatrixTab.refresh()` early-returns when `POOL.has_pending("admin:matrix_ensure")` — prevents mid-write reads and sets `_dirty=True` so the tab reconciles on its next `showEvent`.

- **Matrix lazy refresh** —
  - Every `MatrixTab` now has a `_dirty` flag. On `COST_VIS.changed`, only the **currently visible** tab refreshes immediately; others flip the flag and reconcile on their next `showEvent`. No more stampede of 5-6 parallel DB queries when the 👁 button is clicked.
  - Each `MatrixTab` uses a per-category `POOL_KEY_PREFIX` (`f"matrix_{category_key}"`) so keys never collide between parallel tabs.

- **Per-page migrations off the UI thread** —
  - `SalesPage._load_products` + `SalesPage._refresh` — both split into worker-fetch + UI-thread `_apply_sales` / `_render_products`. Keys: `"sales_products"`, `"sales_refresh"`.
  - `PurchaseOrdersPage._refresh` — `po_repo.get_all` + `po_repo.get_summary` combined into a single `POOL.submit_debounced("po_refresh", …, delay_ms=150)` and applied via `_apply_po_data`.
  - `AuditPage._load_data` — `get_all_audits` + `get_summary` combined into one pooled fetch; KPIs + table render in `_apply_audits` on the main thread.

- **UI watchdog** (new `app/ui/workers/ui_watchdog.py`) —
  - Opt-in dev diagnostic enabled via `SM_UI_WATCHDOG=1`.
  - A 10 ms `QTimer` on the UI thread stamps `time.monotonic()`; a daemon thread polls every 50 ms and logs a warning whenever the stamp is older than a configurable threshold (default 50 ms). Instantly surfaces any regression that puts a sync DB call back on the UI thread.

### Fixed
- Banner chip widths now align correctly with the visible columns when the COST column is hidden (previously over-stretched by one column-width).
- `UnboundLocalError: QScrollArea` on `MatrixTab.__init__` — a nested `from PyQt6.QtWidgets import … QScrollArea` shadowed the module-level import; removed the duplicate.
- Duplicate `BRAND:` label (collapsible section header + filter row) — section header restored to `BRAND & LEGEND` and now wraps both cards + filter together.
- Matrix banner reverted to a slim 30 px name-chip after totals moved to the top card strip; banner keeps column-grouping context without duplicating data.

### Changed
- Matrix edit dialogs for price split into **Sell Price** and **Cost Price** with distinct titles / Undo labels.
- Cost edit instant-repaints the clicked COST cell + neighbouring TOTAL cell synchronously before the DB refresh lands, so the whole edit lands in a single visual frame. SELL edit does the same for TOTAL when not in cost mode.
- Schema version bumped **15 → 16**.

---

## [2.3.9] - 2026-04-20

### Added
#### Pricing · Quick Scan · Invoices
- **Part-type default price** — Admin → Part Types now has a "Default price" field. Every item inheriting the part type takes that price; per-item `sell_price` still overrides. New "PRICE" column in the part-type admin table.
- **€ / Price column in the matrix** — new column per part type. Green when a per-item override exists, grey when falling back to the part-type default. Double-click to edit; Ctrl+Z undoes.
- **Quick Scan live pricing & totals** — pending table now shows **Unit Price** and **Line Total** per scanned line + a totals card with **ITEMS · SUBTOTAL · GRAND TOTAL** (accent green, JetBrains Mono). Currency formatted via `ShopConfig.format_currency`.
- **Customer field on Quick Scan** — optional input; printed on the invoice when present, otherwise a walk-in record.
- **PDF invoices on every commit** — confirming a scan asks **A4 invoice** or **Thermal receipt**, persists the header + line items, and writes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StockPro\StockManagerPro\invoices\INV-YYYYMMDD-NNNN.pdf`. Feed row shows an **Open** button. TAKEOUT → "INVOICE"; INSERT → "STOCK RECEIPT". Layout preference remembered via QSettings.
- **New `ScanInvoiceService`** (A4 + 80 mm thermal fpdf2 layouts) and **`InvoiceRepository`** (day-prefixed numbering + price snapshot per line).

#### Reports — full overhaul
- **5 new reports**: Stock Valuation (per part type, category subtotals, grand total), Sales (with top-10 best sellers), Scan Invoices (IN/OUT history with filter), Expiring Stock (urgency-coloured), Category Performance (stock + movement per category).
- **Inventory report** now groups by **Category → Part Type** with per-section subtotals, a Brand column, and a grand-total emerald bar at the end.
- **Date range picker** on the reports page — presets (Today · 7d · 30d · 90d · This year · Custom) + `QDateEdit` from/to pickers. Applied to every date-aware report.
- **Operation filter** — contextual for Transactions (IN/OUT/ADJUST/CREATE) and Scan Invoices (ALL/IN/OUT).
- **Output path + three actions** — status bar shows the saved PDF path with **Open PDF**, **Open folder** (selects file in Explorer), **Copy path**.
- **`_ReportPDF.header() / footer()` overrides** — shop banner, title subtitle, and `Page X of Y` footer render on **every page** (not just page 1) via `alias_nb_pages()`.
- **Logo support** — `ShopConfig.logo_path` is rendered top-left of every report header when the file exists.
- **Per-table pagination** — every table redraws its column headers on a new page when rows cross the bottom margin.

#### Analytics — professional dashboard
- **Top date-range bar** — Today · 7d · 30d · 90d · Year · Custom, with automatic previous-period comparison.
- **Executive KPI row** — 4 tiles (Stock Value · Revenue · Transactions · Low Stock) each with a trend sparkline, ▲/▼ delta badge vs the previous equal-length period, and click-to-drill-down.
- **Brand-separated Valuation section** — Brand chips row at the top, then one card per brand containing category-grouped part-type rows with **share-of-brand** progress bars, category subtotals, and a brand subtotal strip. Bottom: gradient emerald Grand Total.
- **Valuation filter bar** — Brand combo + Category combo + "Clear filters" button. Active-filter badge shows how many filters are applied; grand total note shows the active filter context.
- **Sales section** — revenue trend dual-line chart with previous-period ghost overlay, mini-KPIs (sales count · units sold · avg basket · best day), top sellers + top customers HBars with currency formatting.
- **Stock movement section** — IN vs OUT dual-line chart, busiest-hours HBar, colour-coded recent activity feed.
- **Scan invoices section** — 4 KPIs (count · IN total · OUT total · avg), daily IN/OUT dual-line, top-invoice-customers HBar.
- **New UI components** — `KpiTile` (label + sparkline + delta + click), `DeltaBadge` (▲/▼ pill), `SkeletonBlock` (animated shimmer), `EmptyState` upgraded (icon + retry button), `PivotTable` redesigned as brand-separated valuation, `DualLineChart` (current + ghost overlay + hover tooltip).
- **`AnalyticsService` facade** — one class computes every tile's data block, safe to run on worker threads; tiles load independently via `POOL.submit` and swap skeletons for content as each block completes.
- **Drill-down navigation** — click KPI tile, pivot row, or brand chip → navigates to the filtered Inventory / Sales / Transactions page.

### Schema
- **V15 migration** — adds `part_types.default_price` (REAL, nullable) + two new tables `scan_invoices` and `scan_invoice_items` for invoice records, with indexes on date and invoice_id.

### New architecture
- **Repository helpers**: `ItemRepository.get_value_by_brand / get_value_by_part_type / get_value_pivot`; `TransactionRepository.get_daily_aggregates / get_hourly_aggregates`; `SaleRepository.revenue_daily / top_customers`; `InvoiceRepository.get_totals / get_daily / get_top_customers`.
- **`ScanSessionService.commit(layout, customer_name)`** — snapshots each line's price to `scan_invoice_items` so historical invoices stay stable even if prices change later.
- **`PendingScanItem`** — gains `unit_price` (captured at scan time) and a `line_total` property.
- **`HBarChart.set_data(..., value_format=callable)`** — optional formatter so chart values render with the shop currency (`€12,340.00`) instead of bare integers.

### Fixed
- **Discrepancy report crash** — added missing `_GRAY_700` / `_GRAY_100` colour constants and implemented the missing `_safe()` sanitiser. PDFs render without `NameError` / `AttributeError`.
- **Column overflow on inventory + transaction reports** — widths re-balanced so columns sum to exactly 186 mm (usable page width).
- **Missing page numbers / orphaned continuation pages** — fixed by header/footer overrides.
- **Reports now save to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StockPro\StockManagerPro\reports\`** — same tree used by invoices and backups (was `%TEMP%`).
- **Valuation pivot ambiguous column bug** — renamed the SQL alias to `brand_name` to avoid clashing with `phone_models.brand` / `inventory_items.brand`, then GROUP BY on the full expression.
- **Brand attribution in reports** — every report resolver now falls back through `model_brand → brand → "(no brand)"`; matrix items no longer show as "(no brand)".
- **Analytics valuation scope** — includes zero-stock brand/part-type combos so the full inventory scope is visible (no more "only Apple and Samsung"); grand total unaffected since zeros add nothing.

### Changed
- **Transaction report** accepts a date range + operation filter (was hardcoded to 30 days with no op filter).
- **Backward-compatible analytics refresh API** — `_fetch_all_data` + `_apply_all_data` still exist so `main_window`'s existing `POOL.submit("analytics_refresh", …)` continues to work; the new implementation forwards to `refresh()` on the main thread.

## [2.3.8] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Content-aware column widths** — every table column now sizes to `max(proportional_target, header_text_fit, widest_cell_fit)` at the active font, so headers and model names are ALWAYS fully visible at any zoom level. Applied to matrix, inventory, transactions, and admin tables.
- **Per-item font scaling** — matrix items with individual `setFont` (`_FONT_MODEL` 11pt, `_FONT_COLOR` 9pt, `_FONT_BRAND` 12pt, `_FONT_DATA` 10pt, `_FONT_MONO` 11pt) now scale correctly via a new `BASE_PT_ROLE` marker that remembers each item's 100% point size
- **Real-time live zoom on slider drag** — every slider tick applies zoom through the 16 ms coalescer; drag feels instant with no lag

### Changed
- **Only the active tab is re-zoomed** on slider changes — previously all 6 matrix tabs were iterated every tick (~15 000 items rebuilt per drag step). Inactive tabs catch up lazily when the user navigates to them via `matrix_tab.refresh()`.
- **QFont cache keyed by (family, weight, base_pt)** — a typical matrix has ~1000 items but only ~5 unique font variants; reusing the cached `QFont` instances drastically reduces allocations during zoom
- **Widget-level QSS on QHeaderView** — overrides app-wide `font-size: 11px` and `padding: 10px 16px` so programmatic `setFont` actually takes effect; header height scales with the font + proportional vertical padding
- **Footer zoom widget fully locked** — every child (slider, buttons, preset, divider) uses `Fixed/Fixed` size policy with `setFixedSize`; preset button is `setFixedSize(56, 22)` so percentage text changes ("50%" ↔ "200%") never shift the layout

### Fixed
- **Table headers disappearing at low zoom** — caused by app-wide QSS overriding per-table `setFont`; now overridden with widget-level stylesheet so headers render at the actual scaled font
- **Model names clipped** — column now measures widest model cell using that cell's own scaled font, not the widget default
- **Footer zoom group stretching during drag** — every inner widget locked to `Fixed` size policy and the group itself pinned to a fixed total width
- **Zoom slider lag** — live-drag now handled via a 16 ms coalescing timer in `ZoomService` plus visible-tab-only dispatch; slider release commits synchronously

---

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Professional table zoom** — `ZoomService` singleton drives footer-slider zoom for data tables only: matrix tabs (Displays, Batteries, Cases, …), inventory product table, transaction table, and every QTableWidget inside admin panels. Clean separation from app-chrome sizing.
- **Redesigned footer zoom widget** — zoom-out button + slider with tick marks at every preset + zoom-in button + preset dropdown (50/75/100/125/150/200 + Fit + Reset) + reset button; grouped in a bordered pill with proper QToolButton hover/pressed states
- **Zoom persistence** — table zoom saved to `ShopConfig.zoom_level`, restored on launch; 500ms debounced save so slider drags don't hit the DB
- **UI Scale admin setting** — new dropdown in Shop Settings → Regional & Display: Small (85%), Normal (100%), Large (115%), Extra Large (130%). Controls overall app chrome size (sidebar, header, footer, base font). Restart required — shows a dialog confirmation on change.
- **Slimmer sidebar default** — base width reduced from 240 px → 192 px for a more professional look; UI Scale enlarges it if the user prefers

### Changed
- **Zoom scope limited to tables** — sidebar, header, footer, dashboard KPI cards, analytics charts no longer respond to the footer zoom slider (by design — use UI Scale for chrome sizing)
- **Truly proportional table scaling** — removed arbitrary font floors (9pt body / 8pt header); minimum 6pt for genuine shrinking at 50% zoom. Column widths, row heights, padding all scale via `ZOOM.scale(base, minimum)` — no hard floors fighting the zoom
- **Zoom shortcuts centralised** — Ctrl+=, Ctrl++, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0, Ctrl+Scroll all route through `ZoomService` so footer + shortcuts + wheel stay in sync
- **Matrix refresh preserves zoom** — after refresh, containers re-apply current zoom factor directly (no round-trip through main window)

### Fixed
- **Header truncation at low zoom** — eliminated by proportional column/padding scaling and lower font floor
- **Zoom reset on tab refresh** — matrix tabs now re-apply zoom to all rebuilt brand containers unconditionally

---

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Undo/redo UI freeze** — undo and redo operations now run on the worker pool instead of the main thread, so the window stays fully responsive during the operation
- **Undo/redo real-time refresh** — after an undo/redo, the currently visible tab (inventory, matrix, transactions, analytics) now refreshes in place; you no longer need to switch tabs and come back to see the changes
- **Undo/redo button responsiveness** — undo/redo buttons re-enable immediately after the DB operation completes, before the view refresh; chained undos feel instant
- **Header truncation at low zoom** — header labels (`MIN-VORRAT`, `BESTELLUNG`, `DIFFERENZ`, `BESTAND`) now stay fully visible when zooming out; column widths measured against the new font and padded with a generous 48px buffer

### Changed
- **Thread-safe undo commands** — all undo/redo command lambdas are now DB-only (no UI calls from worker threads); main-thread refresh handled centrally in `_on_undo_done`
- **Inventory filter on undo** — debounce disabled for the post-undo refresh so the product table updates instantly

---

## [2.3.5] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Per-brand matrix sections** — "All Brands" view shows separate sections per brand, each with its own correct part-type columns; outer scroll with full-sized sections and sticky headers
- **No Colors option** — "No Colors" button in color picker removes all colour variants for a model, keeping only the base product
- **Expanded colour palette** — added Red, Pink, Yellow, Orange to available colours in settings and matrix picker

### Fixed
- **Brand display cleanup** — Samsung/Xiaomi no longer show Apple-only part types (stale inventory rows cleaned on startup)

---

## [2.3.4] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Sticky model column** — frozen left-side table for model names stays visible when scrolling horizontally in the matrix
- **Part-type banner bar** — colour-coded part-type names displayed above column headers via synced QScrollArea
- **Excel-like zoom** — Ctrl+Scroll / Ctrl+Plus/Minus zoom (50–200%) with compact footer slider, auto-reset on page switch, hidden on non-table pages
- **Per-model product colours** — right-click any model row in the matrix to select which colours (Black, Silver, Gold…) per model; same toggle UI in settings Admin → Part Types → Model Colors section (double-click to edit)
- **Series separators** — thin visible divider lines between model series groups (X-series, 11-series, A0x, A1x, S2x) for easier reading
- **Collapsible matrix toolbar** — inventory-style clickable section header to hide/show brand filter and legend chips
- **Auto-fit model column** — frozen model column width auto-sizes to the longest model name
- **Live clock** — footer timestamp updates every second automatically
- **Professional splash screen** — geometric inventory cube icon drawn with QPainter, dynamic version badge from `APP_VERSION`, rounded card with emerald glow
- **Custom app icon** — isometric cube icon as `.ico` (multi-resolution 16–256px) and `.png`, used for window, taskbar, installer, and README
- **Full actions toolbar** — New Product, Export CSV, Import CSV, Report, Bulk Edit, Refresh buttons in inventory dashboard
- **Model reorder** — move up/down buttons in Admin → Models panel (same style as part types)
- **Per-model colours in settings** — Admin → Part Types → Model Colors card shows all models with their colour overrides; double-click to edit
- **Import CSV** — toolbar button opens file picker and imports inventory data directly

### Fixed
- **Theme toggle persistence** — toggling theme now saves to database; closing admin no longer reverts to old theme
- **Theme toggle UI** — sidebar, header, footer, matrix legend chips, inventory section headers all update correctly
- **Zoom separators** — separator rows stay at fixed 3px height during zoom
- **Worker pool crash** — wrapped signal emit in try/except to handle widget deletion during background tasks
- **QFont warning** — suppressed harmless `QFont::setPointSize` Qt warning via `qInstallMessageHandler`
- **UAC rejection** — `launch_installer()` returns `bool`; app only quits if UAC was accepted
- **Download cancel** — cancel button on update download progress dialog
- **Installer cache** — downloaded installer stored in persistent `%LOCALAPPDATA%` cache instead of temp dir
- **Cached installer reuse** — if installer already downloaded and SHA256 matches, skip re-download
- **CSV export** — now opens file save dialog instead of crashing on missing `file_path` argument
- **Quick action undo** — +1/-1 buttons now show undo toast (same as full stock dialog)
- **Quick action detail sync** — +1/-1 updates the detail bar instantly (stock count, status badge)
- **Model reorder** — fixed `reorder()` to preserve brand-specific sort_order base; `get_all()` now sorts by `sort_order` instead of re-sorting naturally
- **Per-model colour removal** — unselected colours now properly deleted from ALL part types, not just one

### Changed
- **Schema V14** — 5 new performance indexes on `inventory_items` (active, stock, part_type_id, model+pt, model+pt+color)
- **Connection pooling** — thread-local cached connections instead of new `sqlite3.connect()` per query
- **SQLite optimised** — `synchronous=NORMAL`, `cache_size=20MB`, `temp_store=MEMORY` pragmas
- **Batch inserts** — `_ensure_all_entries()` uses `executemany()` instead of per-row INSERT (10-50x faster)
- **Deferred health checks** — `run_startup_checks()` moved to background thread after 2s delay
- **Lazy theme loading** — only generates QSS for active theme at startup, not all 4
- **Matrix rendering** — pre-indexed item_map for O(1) model lookup; `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` during bulk cell creation
- **Slim dropdown style** — all QComboBox across the app use minimal bottom-line style (transparent, no box border)
- **Compact filter bar** — 26px controls, no container frame, category inline, icon-only reset button
- **Compact actions bar** — 36px toolbar with 6 action buttons, keyboard hints, themed styles
- **Version unified** — `main.py` and splash screen import `APP_VERSION` from `version.py`
- **Pre-release version parsing** — strips `-rc1`, `-beta` suffixes before comparing
- **Manifest validation** — validates URL format, SHA256 hex, version parseability
- **min_version enforcement** — `check_for_update()` respects `min_version` field
- **CI/CD pipeline** — release branch → PR → auto-merge to main with retry
- **CI version stamping** — auto-stamps `version.py`, `file_version_info.txt`, `.iss`, `README.md` badge

- Removed `setMaximumWidth` caps on all action buttons in the product detail bar

### Changed
- Product name column is now left-aligned and always fills available table width
- Column widths applied via `Interactive` mode — a long barcode no longer steals space from the name column
- Inventory page sections (Overview, Filters, Selected Item) are now individually collapsible — hiding a section gives that space to the product table
- Product table list expands to fill all freed space when sections are collapsed
